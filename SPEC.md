# woo — specification

Programmable persistent objects, single-parent inheritance, modernized types, structured event messaging. A globally distributed successor to LambdaMOO. Cross-operator federation is reserved for v2.

> Status: varies.  Some parts are implemented.  Others are draft.
> If the spec says "implemented", it becomes the reference for behavior.
> When developing, keep the spec aligned with the actual implementation.
> Section numbers in headers are stable references for conversation.

## 1. Vision

**woo** is a multi-user, persistent, programmable world. It is a modern successor to LambdaMOO: it preserves the expressive object/verb/room/player model while reconsidering the architecture, interfaces, safety model, and social expectations for a contemporary networked environment. Every object is independently addressable and stateful. Users (human or agent) connect over websockets, inhabit a player object, and interact by emitting events and invoking verbs on other objects. Objects can be edited and reprogrammed at runtime by sufficiently privileged users; all code is sandboxed in a custom bytecode VM with tick metering and per-task memory caps.

The system is **globally distributed** in the production profile. Every object is its own actor, hosted at the edge, with no single process or node carrying the whole world. v1 runs within one vendor's namespace per deployment. Cross-operator federation (the broader sense of "decentralized") is designed but deferred to v2.

## 1.1 Deployment modes

Woo has three runtime modes:

- **In-memory (development/testing only).** Fast boot, no persistence guarantees, and no required cross-environment promotion workflow.
- **Local SQLite (testing and small self-contained deployments).** Durable process-local storage, simpler operations, and single-environment lifecycle.
- **Cloudflare (production).** Distributed host-per-object deployment with full identity flows, and the only mode that requires a dev/staging/prod pipeline and inter-environment promotion.

For concrete deployment procedures for operators (including Cloudflare account setup and upgrade checks), use [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md). Deployment lifecycle and environment behavior are specified in [spec/operations/deployments.md](spec/operations/deployments.md) and [spec/reference/cloudflare.md §R14](spec/reference/cloudflare.md#r14-deploying-your-own-world).

The system is **infrastructure, not UI**. The chat-text interface is one renderer. The wire protocol is structured events. Browser-hosted "transient" objects participate in the same execution model as server-hosted persistent ones.

The specification should be clear enough that independent implementations can be tested against it. Early implementation sketches are evidence and reference material, not substitutes for the normative spec.

## 2. Concepts and terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Object** | A persistent, individually addressable entity. Holds properties, verbs, location, parent, owner. |
| **Persistent object** | Server-hosted; one persistent host per woo object. Identifier prefix `#`. |
| **Transient object** | Client-hosted (typically browser); lifetime bounded by the connection. Identifier prefix `~`. |
| **Verb** | Callable code attached to an object. Dispatched by name through the standard lookup rule: parent chain, then feature lookup where applicable. |
| **Property** | Named slot on an object. *Defined* on an ancestor (with default + perms); *value* per object. |
| **Player** | An object that has an attached client connection. Just an object, not a separate type. |
| **Task** (VM) | A serializable activation stack; the unit of execution. Migrates between hosts on verb dispatch. Also called a *VM activation* when distinguishing from a taskspace's work-item "task" (see `catalogs/taskspace/DESIGN.md`). |
| **Host** | Anything that can run a VM: an edge worker, a persistent host, or a transient host. |
| **Event** / **Observation** | A structured map (`{type, ...}`) emitted from one object to one or more listeners. The two terms are synonyms: `core.md` says "observation" to distinguish from messages and mutations; `events.md` and the wire/API say "event" by historical naming. |
| **Renderer** | Code that turns events into a presentation. Usually a transient object. |
| **Wizard** | A flag on an object granting elevated permissions. |

## Layers

The spec is split into layers. Implementation references in semantics and protocol layers are explicit pointers to reference profiles; you can read semantics + protocol for all runtimes without committing to Cloudflare.

| Path | Layer | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| [spec/semantics/](spec/semantics/) | **semantics** | Language and object model. Implementation-neutral. |
| [spec/protocol/](spec/protocol/) | **protocol** | Host classes, wire format, browser bootstrap. |
| [spec/reference/](spec/reference/) | **reference** | Concrete Cloudflare mapping. v1 only. |
| [spec/deferred/](spec/deferred/) | **deferred** | Not in v1. Federation, capabilities, audio. |
