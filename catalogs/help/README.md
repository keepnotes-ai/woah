# Help

Source catalog for in-world help databases.

Defines `$generic_help_db` and a seeded `$help` database with the baseline first-light topics. The player-facing `:help` verb is universal player behavior; this catalog supplies the topic store it searches.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the design and behavior contract.
