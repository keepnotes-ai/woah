# Note Demo

Generic notes — portable text-bearing things, modeled after LambdaMOO's
`$note` (#9). The base shape is text plus permissions; subclasses add
behavior (pinboard pins, recipe notes, voting notes, decision logs).

## Classes

| Class | Parent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `$note` | `$portable` | Movable text artifact. Text is a list of strings, one per line; writability gated by owner, the writers list, or wizard. |

## Goal

A first-class movable artifact with editable text. Notes can be created,
read, edited, picked up, dropped, posted onto bulletin boards, taken off
again, and recycled — all using ordinary `moveto`/`take`/`drop`
infrastructure. The note keeps its identity across moves; references,
observations, and editor handoff all work without copy.

## Class

```
$note < $portable < $thing
  .text     list<str>   perms ""   — one string per line; private (verb-only access)
  .writers  list<obj>   perms "r"  — additional writers besides .owner
```

`.text` is `perms ""` deliberately. Direct property reads are denied;
the public API is the `:text()` verb, which gates via `:is_readable_by`.
This keeps the property model open for `$encrypted_note < $note` and
similar privacy-respecting subclasses without changing callers — they
already go through the verb.

Properties inherited from `$portable`:
- `.portable = true` — eligible for `:take`/`:drop` between rooms and
  inventories without changing host placement.

## Verbs

| Verb | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Permission-checking getter for `.text`. Public API for callers that don't run as wizards. |
| `read` / `r@ead` | Call `:text()`, emit a `note_read` observation, return the text. |
| `set_text(lines)` | Replace text. Permission: `:is_writable_by(actor)`. |
| `write(line)` | Append a line. Permission: `:is_writable_by(actor)`. |
| `erase` / `er@ase` | Clear text. Permission: `:is_writable_by(actor)`. |
| `delete(line)` / `del@ete` / `rem@ove` | Remove one 1-based line. Permission: `:is_writable_by(actor)`. |
| `is_readable_by(actor)` | Default `true`. Override in subclasses to restrict. |
| `is_writable_by(actor)` | Owner, members of `.writers`, or wizard. |
| `look` / `look_self` | Standard space/thing look surface. Returns name + line count. |
| `title` | Object name. |

## What is intentionally absent in v0.1

- **Encryption** (`:encrypt`/`:decrypt`). LambdaCore has it; we'll add when
  there's a use case.
- **`mailme` / `@mailme`**. Requires `$mail_recipient`; deferred to a
  future mail catalog.
- **`@notedit`**. Will land as part of `editor-rooms.md` (the `$note_editor`
  is one specialization of `$generic_editor`). The note doesn't need to
  know about editors; the editor knows how to read/write `.text`.

## Design notes

### Why `< $portable`

Every note is a movable thing. We want `take note from board`, `drop note
in room`, `put note in chest`, `post note on board` to all work uniformly.
`$portable` already encodes the cross-host-safe-move semantics. Inheriting
it gives notes those guarantees for free and reuses the existing
`room_take`/`room_drop` natives.

### Why `is_readable_by`/`is_writable_by` are verbs, not properties

Verbs let subclasses override based on context (encryption key matching
on `$encrypted_note`, voting-state on `$voting_pin`, time-of-day for
`$ephemeral_note`). A boolean property would force every subclass to
maintain a flag.

### Why default-public-read

Most notes in social use are signs, posters, recipes, lists — public.
Subclasses needing privacy (`$encrypted_note`, `$private_note`) override
`:is_readable_by` to gate.

### Why `note_read` and `note_edited` schemas

Per-note observability is the whole point of first-class notes. Boards
that mirror posts to a `$mail_recipient` listen for these and forward.

## Cross-references

- `lambdamoo-mail-and-boards.md` — the LambdaMOO inspiration: notes,
  bulletin boards, mail recipients as three distinct surfaces.
- `lambdamoo-editors.md` — the `$note_editor` pattern that v0.2 will use
  for `@notedit`.
- `catalogs/pinboard/DESIGN.md` — first concrete subclass (`$pin < $note`)
  via the pinboard redesign.
