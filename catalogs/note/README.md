# note

Generic note class for woo. Modeled after LambdaCore's `$note` (#9): three
explicit slots, three verb paths, no heuristic that mixes them.

A note is a movable text-bearing thing — like a piece of paper. Pick one
up, drop it, post it on a board, take it off, put it in a chest. Read it,
edit the text, replace the text. The note keeps its identity wherever it
goes.

A note has three explicit slots:

| Slot | Field | What for |
|---|---|---|
| **identity** | `name` (inherited from `$root`) | Inventory listing; verb-targeting; the short label that distinguishes one note from another. |
| **cosmetic** | `description` (inherited from `$root`) | What `look at note` shows. Optional; left empty by default. |
| **content** | `text` (string, markdown by convention, capped at 262144 characters) | What `read note` shows. The payload. |

The substrate never derives one from another. Producers set `name` and
`text` at creation. Authors edit `name` and `text`. The cosmetic
description is set explicitly when wanted, otherwise left empty.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the app design and behavior contract.

## Class

`$note < $portable < $thing < $root`

Properties: `.text` (string, perms `""`, capped at 262144 characters),
`.writers` (list of additional writer objects beyond the owner).
Identity (`.name`) and cosmetic (`.description`) are inherited from
`$root`.

## Verbs

```
:text                   permission-checking getter for the full text
:text_summary(limit)    bounded display summary {lines, length, preview, truncated}
:read                   show the text and emit a note_read observation
:set_text(str)          replace the entire text (writers only); enforces 262144-char cap
:write(line)            append a line (writers only); inserts a newline if non-empty
:erase                  clear the text (writers only)
:add_writer(who)        add a writer (owner or wizard only)
:rm_writer(who)         remove a writer (owner or wizard only)
:is_readable_by(actor)  default true; override in subclasses to restrict
:is_writable_by(actor)  owner, .writers entries, or wizard
:look / :look_self      standard look surface (title, description, text_length, location)
```

Writer-list changes emit `note_writers_changed` with the current
`writers` list so pinboard/card UIs can update edit controls from
observations.

`:title` is inherited from `$root` and just returns `this.name`. There
is no first-line-is-title heuristic.

`.text` is private (`perms: ""`); always go through `:text()` for full
body reads, or `:text_summary(limit)` for bounded display previews. The
private property keeps `$encrypted_note` and other privacy-respecting
subclasses possible without changing callers — they override the verbs
rather than touching `.text` directly.

## Use it

```moo
let note = create($note, { name: "Tea recipe" });
note:set_text("1. Boil water.\n2. Add tea.");
note:read();
```

LambdaMOO-style line editing also works:

```moo
note:write("3. Drink.");          // appends with a newline
note:erase();                     // clear
```

## Subclassing

The `pinboard` catalog ships `$pin < $note` adding `.color`. The
`dispenser` catalog ships `$dispensed_note < $note` adding back-references
to the producing block. The `taskspace` catalog ships `$task < $note`
where `text` carries the markdown task description. Other natural
subclasses: `$voting_note` (adds vote counts), `$ephemeral_note`
(auto-recycles after a TTL), `$encrypted_note` (overrides
`:is_readable_by` with key check). Each adds verbs/properties; the base
shape stays the same.

## Breaking change from v0.1

v0.1 had `text: list<str>` and a `:title()` heuristic that prepended the
first text line onto the name. v0.2 keeps the property name `text` but
changes the type to a single string, drops the heuristic, and bounds the
text size:

- `text: list<str>` → `text: str` (markdown, capped at 262144 characters)
- `:title()` → inherited from `$root`, returns `this.name`
- `:set_text(lines)` → `:set_text(str)` — same name, different argument shape
- `:write(line)` keeps its LambdaMOO semantics (append a line, inserting
  a newline if the text is non-empty)
- `:erase` keeps its LambdaMOO semantics (clear the text)
- `:delete(line)` removed — line numbers no longer make sense for a
  single string body

Upgrades from v0.1 worlds run two automatic boot migrations:

- `2026-05-06-note-text-string-shape` walks every `$note` descendant and
  joins any list-of-strings `text` value into a single newline-joined
  string. Idempotent on already-string values.
- `2026-05-06-note-stale-class-verbs` reconciles class verbs on `$note`
  and its bundled subclasses, removing the v0.1 `:title` heuristic and
  the `:delete`/`:set_text(list)` shapes that no longer apply.

## Future

- `:encrypt(key)` / `:decrypt(key)` — LambdaCore-style locked notes.
- `:mailme(actor)` — once a `$mail_recipient` catalog exists.
- `:render_text(profile)` — ANSI/text-mode rendering of the markdown body.
