# Taskspace Demo

Taskspace is the smallest useful async coordination app: a shared space where
people and agents coordinate work through hierarchical projects/tasks,
requirements, statuses, messages, and references to artifacts.

## Classes

| Class | Parent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `$taskspace` | `$space` | Coordination space for hierarchical work. Extends `$space` with root task ordering and task-creation behavior. |
| `$task` | `$note` | Work item and note/card artifact. Inherits note text/writer semantics while storing task-specific title, description, status, assignee, requirements, artifacts, messages, parent linkage, and ordered subtasks. |

## Goal

Show that Woo can host a durable, asynchronous coordination world with a UI that
is completely unlike Dubspace.

Taskspace should prove that `$space:call` is not a music-specific sequencer. It
is a general coordination primitive for ordered message passing.

## Core Requirement

The demo runs inside one minimal `$space`. The `$space` accepts calls/messages
and assigns monotonically increasing sequence numbers.

All task lifecycle changes are caused by sequenced calls. Current task state is
the materialized result of applying those calls. No global clock is required for
ordering.

## Surface

- One shared taskspace.
- Two actors: person, agent, or two guests.
- One project root.
- Three tasks in a hierarchy.
- Subtasks nested under at least one task.
- Requirement checklist per task.
- Status per task.
- Assignee per task.
- Message/activity timeline.
- Artifact reference list.
- Ephemeral embedded chat on `the_taskspace` using `chat:$conversational`.

## Persistent State

- Task title and description.
- Parent task/project ref.
- Ordered child task refs.
- Task status: `open`, `claimed`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
- Current assignee.
- Requirement items and checked state.
- Artifact refs: file path, URL, commit, note id, or external id.
- Task messages/comments.

## Calls

- `taskspace:create_task(title, description)`
- `task:add_subtask(title, description)`
- `task:move(parent, index)`
- `task:claim()`
- `task:release()`
- `task:set_status(status)`
- `task:add_requirement(text)`
- `task:check_requirement(index, checked)`
- `task:add_message(body)`
- `task:add_artifact(ref)`

The exact verb names may change. The important requirements are:

- task/project structure is hierarchical
- breakdown into subtasks is a first-class operation
- each structural or status change is represented as a sequenced call through
  the taskspace

These verbs are catalog-authored source, not runtime-native handlers. The only
new runtime primitive the app needs is generic `create(parent, owner_or_options?)`
for minting persistent objects.

## Observations

- Task created.
- Subtask added.
- Task moved/reordered.
- Task claimed or released.
- Status changed.
- Requirement added or checked.
- Message added.
- Artifact attached.

## Observation Schemas

Each observation the taskspace emits has a defined payload shape:

| Observation | Payload | When emitted |
|---|---|---|
| `task_created` | `{task: obj, parent: obj \| null, title: str}` | After `:create_task` or `:add_subtask`. |
| `subtask_added` | `{parent: obj, child: obj, index: int}` | When a subtask is added to a parent task. |
| `task_moved` | `{task: obj, from_parent: obj \| null, to_parent: obj \| null, index: int}` | After `:move`. |
| `task_claimed` | `{task: obj, actor: obj}` | After `:claim`. |
| `task_released` | `{task: obj}` | After `:release`. |
| `status_changed` | `{task: obj, from: str, to: str}` | After `:set_status`. |
| `done_premature` | `{task: obj, unchecked: list<str>}` | Emitted alongside `status_changed` when a task transitions to `done` with unchecked requirements (soft-DoD). |
| `requirement_added` | `{task: obj, index: int, text: str}` | After `:add_requirement`. |
| `requirement_checked` | `{task: obj, index: int, checked: bool}` | After `:check_requirement`. |
| `message_added` | `{task: obj, actor: obj, body: str, ts: int}` | After `:add_message`. |
| `artifact_attached` | `{task: obj, ref: map}` | After `:add_artifact`. |

All observations include `type` and `source` (the taskspace itself). All are persistent (sequenced via the taskspace).
The embedded chat uses direct `$conversational` verbs, so chat observations are
live-only and do not enter the task lifecycle log.

## Minimal Interactions

- Create three tasks.
- Add two subtasks under one task.
- Claim one task as an actor.
- Mark it in progress.
- Add a requirement.
- Attach one artifact reference.
- Add a message.
- Mark it done.
- See the ordered activity timeline update for all connected actors.
- Expand/collapse the task hierarchy in the UI.

## Not In The Basic Demo

(The Workflow Variant section below adds workflow-gated transitions and roles. These items are out of scope for *both* the basic demo and the variant unless noted.)

- Calendar scheduling.
- Priorities beyond status.
- Task dependencies.
- Cross-project linking.
- Search.
- Notifications.
- Rich permissions beyond per-claimer / per-role gating.
- External integrations.
- Configurable workflows beyond the design-review example in the variant.
- Full project-management UI.

## Hierarchy Rule

Every task belongs to exactly one parent: either the taskspace root or another
task. The hierarchy is a tree, not a DAG.

Completing a parent does not automatically complete children in the tiny demo.
Instead, parent status is explicit actor intent. UI may show derived rollups
such as "2/3 subtasks done," but rollups are observations/materialized views,
not hidden mutations.

## Domain Invariants

Concrete rules the implementation must enforce. Anything not listed here is
deliberately unconstrained.

### Move

`task:move(parent, index)`:

- `parent` may be `null` (move to taskspace root) or an `$task` in the same
  taskspace. Cross-taskspace move is not supported in the demo; raises `E_INVARG`.
- **No cycles.** `parent` must not be `task` itself nor any descendant of `task`.
  Walks the descendant set of `task`; on collision raises `E_RECMOVE`.
- `index` must be in `[0, len(target_subtasks)]` inclusive at the upper bound
  (so `index == len` appends). Out of range raises `E_RANGE`.
- The source location's subtask list (or root list) is updated atomically with
  the destination's. Because all tasks anchor on the taskspace, this is one
  host-local transaction.
- Move emits `task_moved {task, from_parent, to_parent, index}`.

### Claim

`task:claim()`:

- If `assignee == null`: succeeds, sets `assignee = actor`, sets `status = "claimed"`,
  emits `task_claimed`.
- If `assignee == actor`: idempotent no-op (no observation emitted; returns
  current task ref).
- If `assignee != null && assignee != actor`: raises `E_CONFLICT`.

There is no soft "request to claim" or "queue of claimants" in the demo —
claiming is first-come, first-served.

### Release

`task:release()`:

- Calling actor must be the current `assignee`, or have the wizard flag.
  Otherwise raises `E_PERM`.
- Clears `assignee` to `null`. Sets `status` to `"open"` *unless* status was
  `done` — a done-but-released task remains done; only the assignee role is
  cleared.
- Emits `task_released`.
- Reassignment to a different actor is not via `:release` + `:claim` (that
  has a race). Use `wiz:set_assignee(task, actor)` (wizard-only) for
  hand-offs that must be atomic.

### Status

`task:set_status(status)`:

- `status` must be one of the enum values: `open`, `claimed`, `in_progress`,
  `blocked`, `done`. Other strings raise `E_INVARG`.
- The runtime does not forbid any transition. Any-to-any is permitted, but
  non-`done` changes on a claimed task require the assignee or a wizard. Marking
  `done` is deliberately relaxed so anyone can close noisy test/demo tasks.
  `claimed` is normally set by `:claim`; setting it explicitly via `:set_status`
  is permitted but unusual.
- Soft-DoD: on transition to `done` with unchecked requirements, emits
  `done_premature` *in addition to* `status_changed`. The status change still
  applies. (See "Definition of Done" above.)

### Requirements

`task:add_requirement(text)`:

- Appends `{text, checked: false}` to `requirements`. No length limit on `text`
  beyond the value-model max ([values.md §V9](../../spec/semantics/values.md#v9-size-limits)).
- Emits `requirement_added {task, index, text}`.

`task:check_requirement(index, checked)`:

- `index` must be in `[0, len(requirements))` (exclusive upper bound here, since
  this references an existing item, not an insert position). Out of range raises
  `E_RANGE`.
- Sets `requirements[index].checked = checked`. Idempotent if already at that value.
- Emits `requirement_checked`.

Removing requirements is not in the demo. Mark with a checked-strikethrough in
the UI if needed.

### Comments

`task:add_message(body)`:

- Open to any actor with presence in the taskspace. Comments are social
  commentary; gating them defeats the timeline as a coordination tool.
- Stored as `{actor, ts, body}`; `actor` is the calling actor, `ts` is the
  ms epoch at apply time.
- `body` is plain text in first-light. Markdown/rich-text deferred.
- Emits `message_added`.

Comments are not editable or deletable in the demo. The audit trail is the value.

### Artifacts

`task:add_artifact(ref)`:

- Open to any actor with presence in the taskspace. Reviewers and observers
  routinely attach artifacts.
- `ref` must be a map matching the artifact-ref shape below; otherwise
  `E_INVARG`.
- Emits `artifact_attached`.

Removing artifacts is not in the demo.

### Artifact reference shape

```
{
  kind:       str,        // one of the kinds below
  ref:        str,        // kind-specific identifier
  label?:     str,        // optional human-readable label
  added_by?:  obj,        // filled by the runtime on add (calling actor)
  added_at?:  int         // filled by the runtime on add (ms epoch)
}
```

Recognized kinds for first-light:

| `kind`     | `ref` format                          | Example                     |
|---|---|---|
| `file`     | path or relative URI                  | `"/spec/values.md"`         |
| `url`      | absolute URL                          | `"https://example.com/x"`   |
| `commit`   | `repo@hash`                           | `"woo@01a2b3c"`             |
| `note`     | internal note objref                  | `"#01HXYZ..."`              |
| `task`     | objref of another task (cross-link)   | `"#01HXYZ..."`              |
| `external` | opaque external identifier            | `"linear:WOO-42"`           |

Implementations may add custom kinds; an unrecognized kind is preserved as-is
and the UI falls back to displaying `ref` literally.

### Permissions summary

| Verb                      | Who can call                         |
|---|---|
| `:create_task`, `:add_subtask` | Any actor with presence.        |
| `:move`                   | Any actor with presence in this demo. |
| `:claim`                  | Any actor with presence (success depends on current assignee). |
| `:release`                | Current assignee, or wizard.         |
| `:set_assignee`           | Wizard-only.                         |
| `:set_status`             | Any actor with presence. Soft-DoD provides social pressure, not enforcement. |
| `:add_requirement`, `:check_requirement` | Any actor with presence. |
| `:add_message`            | Any actor with presence.             |
| `:add_artifact`           | Any actor with presence.             |

This is the demo's open default. Projects that want stricter rules apply the
per-claimer-update pattern from
[identity.md §I7.1](../../spec/semantics/identity.md#i71-the-per-claimer-update-pattern)
with whichever fields fit.

## Definition of Done

The requirements list is the task's definition of done. The runtime does not
gate `set_status("done")` on requirements being met; the actor's intent to mark
complete is honored. But if any requirements are unchecked when `done` is set,
the runtime emits a `done_premature` observation alongside the status change,
listing the unchecked items.

This is **soft enforcement**: the activity timeline shows "marked done with N
unchecked requirements," and the UI can warn or display this prominently. Hard
enforcement (raise `E_PRECONDITION` instead of emitting a warning) is an opt-in
flag per task or per project, not built into the tiny demo.

The reasoning: aspirational requirements are normal early in a task's life;
rigid gates would force premature checklist construction. The soft form
records intent without blocking it.

## Roles and Authority

The tiny demo has one role: `assignee` (set by `claim`, cleared by `release`).
Real-world taskspaces add whatever roles the project needs by setting
actor-typed properties on the task and checking them in verb bodies. There is
no built-in role taxonomy.

Three concrete patterns:

- **Reviewer.** Set a `reviewer: obj` property and write a `task:review(verdict)`
  verb that checks `progr == this.reviewer`. Flips the task to a project-defined
  status (`reviewed`, `accepted`, whatever); emits a review observation.
- **Watchers.** A `watchers: list<obj>` property; an `:on_status_changed`
  handler iterates and emits a notification observation to each. No permission
  gating — watchers receive but don't act.
- **Requestor.** A `requestor: obj` property set once at creation, never gated
  for permission. Surfaced in the UI for context; doesn't constrain behavior.

The pattern is the per-claimer check from
[identity.md §I7.1](../../spec/semantics/identity.md#i71-the-per-claimer-update-pattern)
generalized: any actor-typed property can become a role, and any verb can gate
itself on `progr` matching that property. The platform permits; it does not
prescribe.

This is what lets the skeleton stay skeletal while still being usable for real
work — a project that needs verifier-gated done adds a `verifier` property and
a `task:verify` verb. A project that needs requestor-tracking-without-gating
adds a `requestor` property and reads it in the UI. None of these add runtime
machinery; they are all just object data and verb code.

## Workflow Variant (useful taskspace)

The basic demo above uses the open-policy `:set_status` (any actor, any transition). For a useful coordination platform, the same taskspace can declare a [workflow](../../spec/operations/workflows.md) that gates transitions on roles and entrance conditions. This is the cut you'd actually use to coordinate work between agents (or people).

### Example workflow

A design-review pipeline:

```
states:      design → design-review → implementation → implementation-review → done

transitions:
  design                 → design-review            performer + min_artifacts:1
  design-review          → design                   reviewer (reject)
  design-review          → implementation           reviewer (approve)
  implementation         → implementation-review    performer + min_artifacts:1
  implementation-review  → implementation           reviewer (reject)
  implementation-review  → done                     reviewer (approve)
```

The workflow-bearing taskspace class declares this as its default `workflow` property; tasks created in it inherit the gating.

### Additional roles + verbs

Each task carries `performer` and `reviewer` properties (alongside or replacing `assignee`). New verbs:

- `:claim_role("performer" | "reviewer")` — set the role property; raises `E_CONFLICT` if filled by another actor, `E_CAPABILITY` if the claimer's tier is below the task's required tier.
- `:release_role(role)` — clear; current role-holder or wizard only.
- `:transition(to)` — workflow-gated transition; sugar for `:set_status(to)`.
- `:submit(artifact)` — append artifact + transition to next state if entrance conditions are met.

### Task properties for agent routing

When the same taskspace coordinates AI agents at different capability tiers, two extra properties on each task make routing predictable (per [workflows.md §WF11](../../spec/operations/workflows.md#wf11-capability-gating-for-agent-claims)):

- `capability: "low" | "medium" | "high" | null` — minimum claimer tier. Defaults null (no constraint). Set per task at creation, or by a wizard later.
- `token_budget: int | null` — advisory estimate of tokens to complete the work; surfaced in listings so agents can self-select.

A `$ai_agent` is a `$player` subclass with `model` and `capability` fields. Concrete agent operators define their own mapping from model to tier; the runtime only enforces the scalar comparison at claim time.

### Agent loops

A **performer agent** at tier `medium` running model `claude-sonnet-4-6`:

```
1. tasks = $taskspace:items_unfilled("performer", $me.capability)
2. pick one (consider task.token_budget against your per-call cap)
3. #task:claim_role("performer")          // E_CAPABILITY if mis-tiered
4. work; #task:add_artifact({ kind: "url", ref: "..." })
5. #task:transition("design-review")
```

A **reviewer agent**:

```
1. tasks = $taskspace:items_in_state("design-review", $me.capability)
2. filter to tasks where reviewer is null or $me
3. #task:claim_role("reviewer")  (if not already)
4. inspect via :describe()
5. either #task:transition("implementation") (approve)
       or #task:transition("design") with #task:add_message("rationale") (reject)
```

These flows compose with the [REST API](../../spec/protocol/rest.md): the agent's runtime makes ordinary HTTP calls, no WebSocket required.

### Why this is "useful"

Two actors with different roles hand off through reviewable states; the platform enforces correctness on transitions and entrance conditions; the listing verbs make the agent loop predictable and discoverable. This is the smallest workflow that's recognizably real coordination — anything bigger (priorities, dependencies, sprints, calendars) layers on top.

## Tasks Are Objects (Not Records)

Taskspace deliberately models tasks as full `$task` objects rather than as
value records on `the_taskspace`. `$task` is a `$note` descendant: it can be
treated as a movable text/card artifact by note-aware surfaces, while still
carrying task-specific lifecycle properties and verbs.

The reason is identity and hierarchy. A task has its own lifecycle that other
parts of the world refer to: subtasks point at parents, artifacts may pin to
tasks, future workflows attach roles and watchers. That cross-reference is
cleaner with object refs than with `(taskspace, board_local_id)` tuples — the
language already speaks in obj. A task can also carry its own verbs (`claim`,
`set_status`, etc.), so per-task affordances surface directly through the
existing class/verb model rather than as space-level proxies.

The cost is per-instance reachability: the agent has to enter taskspace
discovery via `the_taskspace:list_tasks()` and `$actor:focus(task)` to
materialize a specific task's verbs as MCP tools (per
[mcp.md §M3.1](../../spec/protocol/mcp.md#m31-working-set-actorfocus)). Cross-host
reachability ([mcp.md §M3](../../spec/protocol/mcp.md#m3-reachability--what-shows-up-where))
ensures `$task` instances created on the taskspace's host appear in the tool
list once focused, without taskspace-specific plumbing in the gateway.

The two models are both first-class in v1; pinboard for flat coordination
surfaces, taskspace for hierarchical work items with lifecycles.

## Why This Demo Exists

Dubspace proves live shared control. Taskspace proves durable async
coordination.

Together they show the platform breadth:

- Dubspace: low-latency, sensory, shared UI state.
- Taskspace: long-lived, inspectable, agent-friendly coordination state.

The two demos should share the same core mechanism: actors make `$space:call`
requests, T0 VM bytecode applies them, and observations explain what changed.
