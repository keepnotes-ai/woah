# Observability

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **operations**.

The contract for what an operator can see about a running woo deployment: logs, metrics, traces, audit. The operational counterpart to the user-facing `:on_$error` observation: those tell users *their* call failed; this tells operators *the platform* is or isn't healthy.

---

## O1. Three flavors of telemetry

- **Logs** — discrete events: a host started, a session ended, a wizard ran a migration, a quota was exceeded. Structured records, queryable.
- **Metrics** — aggregate counters and histograms: calls/sec, p99 latency, storage bytes, memory used. Time-series.
- **Traces** — per-call execution: each `$space:call` produces a span tree showing validate → sequence → resolve verb → run → emit. Sampled.

Each addresses a different operator question. Logs answer "what just happened?" Metrics answer "is the platform healthy?" Traces answer "why was this call slow?"

---

## O2. Per-call traces

Every `$space:call` produces a structured trace:

```ts
{
  trace_id:   str,            // unique per call
  call:       { space, message, seq? },
  spans: [
    { name: "validate",     start: int, end: int, status: "ok" | "fail" },
    { name: "authorize",    start: int, end: int, status: ... },
    { name: "sequence",     start: int, end: int, seq_assigned: int },
    { name: "resolve_verb", start: int, end: int, verb: { definer, name, version } },
    { name: "run",          start: int, end: int, ticks: int, mem_peak: int },
    { name: "commit",       start: int, end: int },
    { name: "emit",         start: int, end: int, observation_count: int }
  ],
  result: "applied" | "rejected" | "behavior_failed",
  error?: ErrValue
}
```

Traces are sampled by default (e.g., 1 in 100 calls). The platform may dial up sampling for spaces under investigation. Wizard ops force-trace any call.

Trace storage is operator policy: defaults to 7-day retention with structured query (op id, error code, latency bucket).

## O3. Per-host metrics

Each persistent host emits standard metrics:

- `calls_per_sec` (rate)
- `direct_calls_per_sec` and sequenced `applied` frames (rates by route)
- `call_latency_p50/p95/p99` (histogram, ms)
- `error_rate` (rate, per error code)
- `tick_budget_consumed_p99` (histogram)
- `memory_peak_bytes` (histogram)
- `storage_bytes_used` (gauge)
- `storage_flush_slices` (histogram/counter by slice kind: objects, properties, sessions, tasks, counters)
- `parked_tasks` (gauge)
- `inbound_rate_drops` (counter)
- `outbound_overflow_drops` (counter)

These are scraped per host on a fixed interval (default 30s). Aggregated up to per-cluster, per-deployment views.

---

## O4. Per-actor / per-space metrics

For multi-developer, multi-team operations:

- `calls_by_actor` (counter, per actor)
- `errors_by_actor` (counter, per actor)
- `quota_consumed_by_owner` (gauge: storage, object count, parked tasks)
- `space_active_subscribers` (gauge, per space)
- `replay_request_rate` (rate, per space — useful for catching gap-recovery storms)

These let operators see who's consuming what, surface noisy actors, and bound team-level quota usage ([teams.md](../identity/teams.md)).

---

## O5. Audit log

Wizard actions and high-privilege operations log to a separate, immutable, append-only audit channel:

- Wizard-flag bypass invocations (`is_wizard(progr)` returning true on a permission check).
- `set_verb_code` / `set_verb_info` / `define_property` / `delete_property` against objects the caller doesn't own.
- `set_quota` overrides.
- Account suspensions, deletions, recovery uses.
- Worktree promotes (who, when, what cluster, what patches).
- Migration runs (who, when, which migration, completion status).
- Backup/restore operations.

Audit retention defaults to indefinite with archival rotation; review tooling lives in the IDE or external observability.

---

## O6. Logs

Structured logs flow from every host. Standard fields: `ts`, `host`, `level`, `event`, plus event-specific data. Levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.

Standard event types include:

- `host.started` / `host.hibernated` / `host.crashed`
- `session.opened` / `session.closed` / `session.detached`
- `space.call.applied` (sample-routed; full traces are separate)
- `space.call.failed` with full err
- `quota.exceeded`
- `migration.started` / `migration.batch_complete` / `migration.complete`
- `wizard.action` (cross-references audit)

Logs are queryable by structured field; the platform's log backend is operator choice.

---

## O7. Dashboards and alerts

Reference dashboards (operators may customize):

- **Overview**: per-deployment calls/sec, error rate, p99 latency, storage utilization.
- **Per-space health**: each major `$space`'s sequencing rate, applied-ok rate, gap-recovery rate.
- **Per-actor activity**: top actors by call rate, error rate.
- **Migrations**: in-flight migration progress, recent runs.

Reference alerts:

- p99 latency > 5s for 10 minutes.
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes.
- Outbound overflow > N drops in 1 minute.
- Quota exceeded for any owner.
- Migration stalled (no batch progress for 1 hour).
- Audit events of severity warn or above.

---

## O8. Privacy / PII

Logs and traces capture call payloads. If those payloads contain user data, the platform must:

- Redact known-PII fields by default (configurable via per-property flag).
- Permit per-event sampling reduction.
- Allow operators to drop specific fields from trace storage.
- Encrypt audit logs at rest.

This is a configuration policy, not a runtime mandate; implementations may ship with conservative defaults (redact all string property values longer than 64 bytes in traces; only object refs and schema-tagged fields go through verbatim).

---

## O9. What's deferred

- **Distributed tracing across worlds.** When federation v1 lands, traces should propagate; deferred.
- **Profiling** (per-verb tick distributions, hot-path identification). Different feature; richer than per-call traces.
- **Anomaly detection / ML-based alerts.** Pattern-based alerts as above are sufficient for the current contract; learned baselines are v2.
- **Operator runbooks keyed off specific failure modes** (failures.md §F11). These layer on top of observability; not part of the spec.
