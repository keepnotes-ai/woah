# Object addressing and routing

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **protocol**.

How woo objects are addressed via URL, how clients dispatch renderers
from class hierarchy, and the verb conventions that let cross-object
navigation generalize across bundled and third-party content.

The substrate primitives this depends on (object id forms, corenames,
actor focus list) are normative in
[semantics/objects.md](../semantics/objects.md),
[semantics/identity.md](../semantics/identity.md), and
[semantics/features.md](../semantics/features.md). The wire endpoints
this builds on are normative in [protocol/rest.md](rest.md). This
document defines the URL-shaped client view and the navigation
conventions on top of those substrates.

---

## AR1. Motivation

Today's bundled SPA holds per-tab state in memory: the selected task,
focused pin, current dubspace scene. None of it survives a refresh,
none of it is shareable as a link, and none of it is addressable from
MCP. Cross-tab navigation (kanban card → task in tasks) is
hardcoded in the SPA — there's no mechanism for a third-party catalog
or an external agent to express the same jump.

Goal: a single addressing model that

- gives every navigation a URL,
- lets new catalog classes acquire rendering and linking without an
  SPA code change,
- stays human-readable when the object has a corename or seed name,
- promotes cleanly to ULIDs once the substrate's deterministic id
  allocator lands.

---

## AR2. URL form

The canonical URL is `/objects/<id>` with an optional view hint.

```
/                                          client root / dashboard
/objects/$wiz                              corename
/objects/the_pinboard                      catalog-seed instance name
/objects/%2301H7QXKM6Z3KS9F2YR5W8ABCDE      persistent ref / URL-encoded ULID
/objects/$me                               dynamic corename → actor
/objects/obj_pin_3?view=kanban             same pin, kanban renderer
```

The `<id>` segment accepts the object reference forms from
[rest.md §R2](rest.md#r2-identifiers), plus the seed/runtime names
the current local and bundled deployments already expose:

- `$<name>` — corename. URL-safe; no percent-encoding.
- `<seed_name>` — catalog-seed instance name (`the_pinboard`,
  `the_chatroom`, `obj_pin_3`).
- `%23<ulid>` — URL-encoded persistent ref (`#` + Crockford base32),
  when the deterministic allocator lands (per
  [reference/cloudflare.md §R14.5](../reference/cloudflare.md#r145-id-determinism-status)).
- `<runtime_counter>` — current `obj_*` / `the_*` runtime-counter form;
  honoured for compatibility, gradually displaced by ULIDs.

All forms resolve through the same object-resolution path the REST
surface uses today. URLs that arrive through a corename remain
correct when the underlying object's id changes — the corename is the
indirection. `$me` is dynamic and resolves to the authenticated actor.

The corresponding API path for a client to fetch the object's state is
`/api/objects/<id>` ([rest.md §R4](rest.md#r4-describe)). The
client-facing URL is `/objects/<id>` (no `/api` prefix); the worker
serves the SPA bundle for any non-API path via the existing
`not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` policy in
`wrangler.toml`.

---

## AR3. View hint

`?view=<name>` is an optional client hint about which renderer to use
when an object supports more than one. The runtime ignores it; the
client dispatches locally.

```
/objects/the_pinboard                      default renderer (board view)
/objects/the_pinboard?view=list            same object, list view
/objects/obj_pin_3                         pin detail in pinboard
/objects/obj_pin_3?view=kanban             same pin, kanban renderer
```

Unknown view values fall back to the class default (AR4). The query
string does not propagate to API calls — the API is view-agnostic.

---

## AR4. Renderer dispatch

A client picks a renderer from the addressed object's class hierarchy.
The class → renderer mapping is **client-side state**; the substrate
neither tracks it nor enforces it. The catalog-owned client UI framework in
[ui-component-model.md](ui-component-model.md) refines this into UI modules,
components, frames, observation handlers, and item renderers; this section
defines the routing-level fallback rule. The bundled SPA ships a default table
approximately:

| Class chain | Default renderer |
|---|---|
| `$chatroom`, `$persistent_chatroom` | chat |
| `$pinboard` | pinboard (spatial) |
| `$kanban_board` | kanban |
| `$task_registry`, `$task` | tasks |
| `$dubspace` | dubspace |
| `$generic_editor`, `$verb_editor` | editor |
| `$builder`, `$programmer` | IDE / authoring |
| (anything else) | fallback: `:describe()` + verb list |

For an object whose class isn't recognised, the fallback renderer
fetches `/api/objects/<id>` and surfaces the permission-filtered
introspection output and actor-callable verb set. This means
addressing an existing but unknown object never 404s in the client; it
degrades to a generic view. If the API returns `E_OBJNF`, the client
renders a not-found view. If the API returns `E_PERM`, the client
renders a no-access view per AR10.

A `?view=` value the client knows about overrides the default. Values
the client doesn't recognise fall back to the class default rather
than failing.

---

## AR5. Human navigation and MCP focus

`$actor.focus_list` remains the MCP working set: agents use it to make
objects reachable through tools. Browser URL navigation is human UI
state. The two concepts are related but not the same contract:

- A human client navigating to `/objects/X` MAY call `$me:focus(X)` as
  a convenience so the object also joins the actor's MCP working set.
- A client MUST NOT treat arbitrary `$me:focus(X)` calls as browser
  navigation commands. Agents use MCP focus for their own working set;
  their focus changes should not make a human browser tab jump.
- If a deployment wants shared human/agent co-navigation, it should be
  an explicit collaboration feature layered on top of this spec, not
  default URL behavior.

For v1, URL state is the client's primary navigation state. MCP focus
is optional integration state.

---

## AR6. The `:locate()` verb convention

Every renderable class SHOULD define a direct-callable `:locate()`
verb that returns a navigation hint:

```woo
verb $task:locate() rxd {
  return {
    object: this,
    view: "tasks",
    parent: this.tasks,
    title: this.title
  };
}

verb $pin:locate() rxd {
  return {
    object: this,
    view: "pinboard",
    parent: location(this),
    title: this.name
  };
}
```

Return-shape contract:

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `object` | yes | The object's own id (typically `this`). What the URL addresses. |
| `view` | optional | Hint mapping to a renderer or `?view=` value. Default if omitted: the class's renderer. |
| `parent` | optional | The "containing" object for breadcrumbs and back-navigation. Often the room or space the object lives in. |
| `title` | optional | Short label for navigation UI (link text, tab title). |

Callers with an objref that want to construct a navigation target —
the SPA emitting a "share link," an MCP agent surfacing a result —
call `:locate()` and build the URL from the result. The convention
keeps URL construction off the client side: the class decides what
"a link to me" means.

`:locate()` is direct-callable: navigation generation should be cheap
and side-effect-free.

---

## AR7. Cross-view bridge verbs

Some navigations are between *different objects* that share a domain
relationship — a kanban card and the task it represents, a pinboard
note and an associated $forum_post, a dubspace control and the
preset it currently embodies. These are per-class and optional.

Convention: `:open_in_<view>()` returns the related object's id (or
its `:locate()` hint).

```woo
verb $kanban_card:open_in_tasks() rxd {
  return this.task_id;
}

verb $pin:open_in_tasks() rxd {
  // Pins do not bridge to tasks.
  return null;
}
```

Return:

- An objref → client navigates to `/objects/<that-id>`.
- A locate-shaped map (with `object` and optional `view`) → client
  uses it directly without re-resolving via `:locate()`.
- `null` → no related object; the bridge isn't applicable for this
  instance.

The client's "open in X" affordance is dispatched by checking which
`:open_in_<view>()` verbs the current object exposes (via
`:describe()` or `match_verb`). Class authors advertise their bridges
without the client needing per-class wiring.

The view name in the verb name (`tasks`, `kanban`, etc.) matches
the renderer registry's view ids (AR4). New views land by adding to
the registry and (optionally) implementing bridges from related
classes.

---

## AR8. Default-object resolution

`/objects/<class_name>` for "show me a default instance of this
class" is tempting but ambiguous (which instance?). For v1, URLs MUST
address concrete objects: `/objects/the_pinboard`, not
`/objects/$pinboard`.

Convenience aliases (e.g. `/chat` → `/objects/the_chatroom`) MAY be
implemented as client-side redirects. They're not normative in this
spec; treat them as SPA UX sugar.

---

## AR9. ULID surfacing

When the deterministic allocator lands (per [reference/cloudflare.md
§R14.5](../reference/cloudflare.md#r145-id-determinism-status)):

- Catalog seeds and corenames keep their names. URLs that addressed
  `the_pinboard` or `$wiz` continue to work.
- Runtime-created persistent objects emit persistent refs (`#` +
  ULID) as their canonical id. URLs for those objects start showing
  the URL-encoded persistent-ref form.
- `:describe()` returns the persistent ref in its `id` field; clients
  display it in detail panes and "copy link" affordances.
- The "share link" affordance prefers the most stable form available
  for the object — corename if present, else seed name, else
  persistent ref, else the runtime counter form.

URLs are **the** primary surface where ULIDs become user-visible.
Today's `obj_the_pinboard_3`-style ids are deployment-local; ULIDs
are globally unique and survive world resets and snapshot moves.
Bookmarking `/objects/%2301H7QXKM…` is durable across that lifecycle in
a way bookmarking `/objects/obj_the_pinboard_3` is not.

The URL bar may show whichever form the user navigated through; the
*share / copy link* affordance emits the canonical form from
`:locate().object`. Class authors who want the share link to be a
specific form override `:locate()` to return the preferred id.

---

## AR10. Identity and access

URLs require an authenticated session to resolve any object the actor
can read. Hitting `/objects/X` without a session falls through to the
client's auth flow; on success the client navigates to the requested
URL.

Sharing a URL does NOT share the session. Recipients authenticate as
themselves and see the addressed object subject to their own read
permissions. A URL that resolves an object the recipient can't read
SHOULD render a "no access" view (the URL is valid; the actor's
authority is what's missing) rather than a hard 403 page. This avoids
leaking object existence as an authorization-side oracle.

URL contents do not carry actor-scoped data. `/objects/$me` resolves
*per-recipient* — sharing it gives the recipient a link to their own
actor, not the sharer's.

---

## AR11. History and back/forward

Clients SHOULD use the browser History API (`pushState` /
`replaceState`) so back / forward work natively. No additional
substrate hooks are needed; navigation is client state. An
implementation MAY also update `$actor.focus_list` per AR5.

Restoring a tab from history MUST re-fetch the object's current state
(the world may have moved since the URL was first visited). Clients
SHOULD NOT cache `/api/objects/<id>` responses in URL-restoration
flows for longer than a few seconds.

---

## AR12. Conformance

A client conforms to this section if:

1. URL form `/objects/<id>` resolves the addressed object and
   dispatches to the matching renderer (AR2, AR4).
2. In-app navigation updates the URL via History API or equivalent
   (AR11).
3. Browser URL changes do not require MCP focus changes, and MCP focus
   changes do not drive browser navigation (AR5).
4. `?view=<name>` is honoured when the renderer recognises the value;
   unknown values fall back to the class default (AR3, AR4).
5. Navigation generation for "share link" and cross-view jumps
   consults `:locate()` rather than constructing URLs locally (AR6).
6. "Open in X" affordances dispatch via `:open_in_<view>()` rather
   than per-class hardcoding (AR7).

A class conforms to this section if:

1. It defines `:locate()` returning at minimum `{object: this}`
   (AR6).
2. It MAY define `:open_in_<view>()` per AR7 for cross-view bridges
   it supports.

The substrate is unchanged by this spec — every requirement is on
clients and class authors.

### AR12.1. Minimum implementation profile

A useful first implementation may ship direct URL restoration before
all catalog classes have navigation verbs. The minimum profile is:

1. Parse `/objects/<id>` and `?view=<name>` from the browser URL.
2. Fetch `/api/objects/<id>` and dispatch by class hierarchy, including
   generic, not-found, and no-access fallbacks.
3. Update the URL when the user navigates between already-known bundled
   renderers.
4. Treat MCP focus as optional integration state, not as browser
   navigation input.

That profile is enough for refresh/back/share-by-copying-the-current
URL. `:locate()` blocks only generated share links and catalog-authored
navigation targets. `:open_in_<view>()` blocks only generic cross-view
bridge affordances. Neither blocks basic object-addressed routing.

## AR13. What's not in v1

Each item below is identified, deferred, and noted with the reason it
isn't in this revision.

- **Remote catalog UI loading.** The object-addressed client uses
  `woo-ui/v1` catalog frame declarations as the class-to-renderer registry.
  Bundled first-party catalogs are statically imported by the SPA during the
  local packaging transition. Loading third-party UI modules from catalog
  artifacts, with content hashes and CSP policy, is specified by
  [ui-component-model.md](ui-component-model.md) but remains gated by the
  catalog trust model.

- **Default-instance resolution from a class URL.**
  `/objects/$pinboard` ("show me a default pinboard") is not
  normative; clients MUST address concrete instances. Convenience
  aliases live in client-side redirect tables (AR8). A spec-level
  convention can be added if the pattern proves consistent across
  catalogs.

- **ULID-canonical IDs.** Awaits the substrate-level deterministic
  allocator (`reference/cloudflare.md §R14.5`). All other parts of
  this spec are forward-compatible: when ULIDs land, URLs auto-track
  via the existing four-form id resolution (AR2).

- **`:locate()` and `:open_in_<view>()` in catalog tooling.** Class
  authors hand-write these verbs today. A catalog-manifest field that
  auto-generates them from declared metadata would be useful but
  isn't speced.

- **URL fragments (`#` anchors).** Used today only for in-page
  navigation; not part of this contract. A future spec MAY define
  `#section-<id>` for deep-linking inside a renderer.

- **Cross-deployment URL portability.** `/objects/the_pinboard` means
  a different object on a different deployment. URL portability is
  federation-v2 territory.

- **Backward-compatible URL aliases for renamed or recycled objects.**
  If `the_pinboard` is recycled and the corename is reassigned, old
  URLs go to the new object. No alias / redirect ledger is
  maintained.

- **MCP-side bookmarks / saved-URLs.** Could be a future
  `$actor.bookmarks` property; not in v1. Per-actor state already
  exists for focus; bookmarks are a separate persistent store.

- **Primary-vs-auxiliary focus split (AR5).** v1 treats browser
  navigation and MCP focus as separate surfaces. A clean substrate
  split into "primary" and "auxiliary" focus may still be useful for
  agent tooling, but it is not required for URL routing.

- **Server-side rendering / SEO.** A non-SPA HTML response for
  `/objects/<id>` (so crawlers and link-preview unfurlers get
  metadata) is not in scope. The class's `:describe()` output is the
  natural data source if it ever lands.

- **Auth-bypassed public-share URLs.** "Anyone with this link can
  see this object" requires a separate sharing capability (token in
  URL, capability ledger). Not in v1; current rule is recipient
  authenticates and reads under their own permissions (AR10).
