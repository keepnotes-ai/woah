# V2 turn network protocol

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **protocol**.

This document specifies the first buildable protocol draft for the v2 node
network sketched in [notes/2026-05-12-woo-v2-actor-local-vm-turns.md](../../notes/2026-05-12-woo-v2-actor-local-vm-turns.md).

It is **not** a compatibility revision of the v1 host-per-object deployment.
The v2 goal is functional parity with the current chat, pinboard/kanban, and
dubspace workloads while changing the distribution strategy:

- object placement is not the semantic authority boundary;
- deterministic VM turns are the atomic execution units;
- actor-local shards are execution caches;
- remote execution is whole-turn placement;
- remote execution normally returns state transfer;
- browser-hosted nodes are real nodes with narrow authority.

This document is draft, but it is intended to constrain prototype
implementation. The final byte encoding may change. The state machines and
validation rules should not change casually once implemented.

---

## VTN1. Scope and compatibility

The v2 protocol defines node-to-node and browser-node-to-relay messages for a
network of Woo nodes. A node may hold any combination of:

- actor-local execution cache;
- durable commit-scope state;
- stable anchor pages;
- projection-only display state;
- browser-local UI/audio state;
- live-only session state.

The protocol deliberately avoids a global object-location oracle. It routes
turns by advertised executable capability and validates authority at commit.

The v2 protocol does not require:

- one host per object;
- a global total order;
- compatibility with v1 Cloudflare Durable Object placement;
- exposing node device class in routing messages;
- advertising execution capability from every node.

The protocol does require:

- one clear commit scope for every committed turn;
- deterministic transcripts for committed VM turns;
- authenticated envelopes on authority-bearing paths;
- verifiable state transfer before cache install;
- explicit separation between durable committed frames and live-only events.

## VTN2. Protocol planes

The protocol has four logical planes. One physical WebSocket, HTTP/2 stream, or
DO RPC channel may carry all of them, but implementations MUST preserve the
semantic separation.

| Plane | Purpose | Durable? | Authority-bearing? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Execution | Ask a capable node to run a whole VM turn. | No, except returned transcript/receipt. | Indirectly. |
| Commit | Submit, validate, order, and acknowledge transcripts. | Yes. | Yes. |
| State | Transfer projections, deltas, closures, and snapshot pages. | Cache fill. | Receive authority is checked. |
| Live | Chat lines, gesture previews, cursors, presence hints, subscription control. | No. | Only within live/session policy. |

Messages MUST NOT smuggle durable world mutation through the live plane. Live
verbs may emit observations and update ephemeral session/browser state, but
durable object cells change only through an accepted commit frame.

## VTN3. References, hashes, and positions

The prototype uses canonical JSON values unless a message field explicitly names
binary bytes. Hashes are over canonical bytes with the type name included in the
preimage.

This document reuses the substrate value and event vocabulary: `WooValue` is
defined by [values.md](../semantics/values.md), `WooError` by the runtime error
shape in [failures.md](../semantics/failures.md), and `WooObservation` by
[events.md](../semantics/events.md). Protocol messages may carry these values,
but protocol validation is separate from catalog event-schema validation.

```ts
type NodeRef = string;       // "node:<deployment>:<id>"
type ScopeRef = string;      // "scope:<id>"
type ObjRef = string;        // stable Woo object id
type ActorRef = ObjRef;
type SessionRef = string;    // authenticated live/session connection
type TurnId = string;        // client or node chosen idempotency key
type Hash = string;          // multihash or "sha256:<base64url>"
type Epoch = number;
type Seq = number;

type ScopeHead = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  seq: Seq;
  hash: Hash;
};

type CommitPosition = ScopeHead;
```

A `ScopeHead` names a commit-scope epoch and the last accepted transcript in
that epoch. Epochs fence sequencer/commit-scope migration. Messages that carry
an epoch MUST be rejected if the receiver knows that epoch is stale.

`ScopeRef` is a v2 protocol identifier. During the shadow prototype, the
runtime may store the scope as the existing `ObjRef` directly, with
`scope:<objRef>` as the canonical wire spelling. This is a prototype shortcut,
not a different authority model.

## VTN4. Message envelope

Every v2 protocol message is carried in an envelope:

```ts
type Envelope<T> = {
  v: 2;
  type: string;
  id: string;
  from: NodeRef;
  to?: NodeRef | ScopeRef | SessionRef;
  actor?: ActorRef;
  session?: SessionRef;
  reply_to?: string;
  sent_at?: number;
  expires_at?: number;
  auth: AuthContext;
  trace?: string;
  body: T;
};

type AuthContext = {
  mode: "same_deployment_mac" | "signature" | "session" | "anonymous_advisory";
  key_id?: string;
  signature?: string;
  mac?: string;
  claims?: Record<string, unknown>;
  token?: string;          // present only for mode:"session"
};
```

`sent_at` and `expires_at` are routing metadata. They are not deterministic VM
inputs. A turn that needs time receives it through `LogicalInputs`.

### VTN4.1 Wire encoding

The first browser-relay transport profile uses **JSON-per-WebSocket-message**;
see VTN19 for the M4 WebSocket binding that carries this profile:

- every WebSocket data frame contains exactly one UTF-8 JSON object;
- the JSON object MUST be an `Envelope<T>`;
- `v` MUST be exactly `2`;
- `type` MUST be a registered v2 message type;
- `body.kind`, when present, MUST match the envelope `type`;
- binary page content MUST be base64url-encoded inside JSON fields until a
  later binary profile is specified.

Receivers MUST reject a frame before dispatch when JSON parse fails, the parsed
value is not an object, `v !== 2`, required envelope fields are missing, or
`type` is unknown for the negotiated transport profile. Unknown envelope fields
MAY be ignored only after `v` and `type` are accepted; unknown message types
MUST NOT be treated as advisory no-ops.

The M4 browser-relay profile caps a single WebSocket message at 1 MiB after
UTF-8 decoding. A receiver that sees a larger message MUST close the socket
with WebSocket close code `1009` ("message too big"). Senders MUST chunk large
state pages through `StatePageRef`/`StatePage` transfer rather than exceeding
this cap. A relay MAY enforce a smaller deployment-local cap during overload,
but MUST report it in the open handshake.

### VTN4.2 Session authentication

M4 browser-relay envelopes use `auth.mode:"session"`. The
`same_deployment_mac` and `signature` modes remain reserved for M5 node-node
and cross-deployment work; M4 implementations MUST NOT accept them on the
browser-relay WebSocket.

Session tokens are minted by the existing v1-authenticated HTTP gateway before
the v2 WebSocket opens. The reserved mint path is:

```text
POST /v2/session/mint
```

The full HTTP request/response contract is specified by the gateway profile,
but the gateway MUST issue a token whose claims are the canonical projection of
the v1-authenticated session state at mint time. The resulting token MUST be a
bearer credential scoped to:

- `session`: session id;
- `actor`: actor object id;
- `deployment`: deployment id or local development profile id;
- `issued_at`: Unix milliseconds;
- `expires_at`: Unix milliseconds;
- `scopes`: commit scopes or spaces the session may initially subscribe to;
- `features`: negotiated prototype feature flags;
- `rev`: session revocation/version counter.

On the wire, the browser sends the token in the opening handshake and repeats
it in `auth.token` on every envelope. `auth.claims` is the relay-validated,
canonical subset of the token claims: `session`, `actor`, `deployment`,
`issued_at`, `expires_at`, `scopes`, `features`, and `rev`. Browsers MUST NOT
invent or modify `auth.claims`; relays either fill it before internal dispatch
or reject the envelope.

Relays MUST reject a session token whose `deployment` claim does not match the
relay's own deployment id. Relays MUST also reject a token whose `rev` does not
match the current revocation/version counter in the relay or gateway session
store.

Session tokens MUST expire no later than 15 minutes after minting. A relay MAY
issue a refreshed token on an authenticated control message before expiry.
Revocation is checked by `(session, rev)` against the relay/gateway session
store on connect and at least once every 60 seconds while the socket is open.
If the token expires or is revoked, the relay MUST reject authority-bearing
messages and close the socket with an auth failure close reason.

Authority-bearing browser-relay messages MUST use `session` authentication.
Advisory gossip MAY use `anonymous_advisory` only on trusted local links where
spoofing is not load-bearing; browser-originated live messages are not
anonymous advisory messages.

The tuple `(from, id)` is the envelope idempotency key unless a body-level
`turn.id` or `submit.id` narrows the key further. Receivers MUST make retry of
the same authority-bearing message idempotent for the configured retention
window. In the M4 browser-relay profile, the relay advertises that window in
`TransportHello.idempotency_window_ms`; it MUST be at least 300000 ms.

## VTN5. Cells and atoms

The protocol reasons about object state as cells.

```ts
type CellRef =
  | { kind: "prop"; object: ObjRef; name: string }
  | { kind: "verb"; object: ObjRef; name: string; version?: string }
  | { kind: "parent"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "features"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "owner"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "perms"; object: ObjRef; name?: string }
  | { kind: "location"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "contents"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "lifecycle"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "catalog"; name: string; version?: string };

type CellVersion = {
  cell: CellRef;
  version: string;
  hash?: Hash;
};
```

An implementation MAY store cells differently internally. On the wire, reads,
writes, validation, and transfer proofs use this vocabulary.

The shadow prototype derives versions for `location`, `contents`, `lifecycle`,
and `owner` reads from deterministic cell-content hashes. These versions MUST
NOT depend on wall-clock object metadata such as `modified`, because replaying
the same turn against the same pre-state must produce the same transcript and
post-state hash.

Routing atoms are compact hashes of typed preimages. The preimage MUST include
the atom kind. For private scopes, the preimage MUST also include a
scope/epoch-specific salt known only to authorized participants.

Examples:

```text
obj:#123
cell:prop:#123.location
verb:#note.read@17
parent:#thing
actor:#alice
scope:#living-room
effect:write
route:live
```

Atom hashes route work. They do not prove authority or state correctness.

## VTN6. VM turn

A VM turn is one atomic deterministic execution segment. A turn starts from a
call request and ends when the VM returns, raises, or parks at an explicit
coordination boundary.

```ts
type TurnCall = {
  id: TurnId;
  actor: ActorRef;
  target: ObjRef;
  verb: string;
  args: WooValue[];
  caller?: ObjRef;
  route: "committed" | "live";
};

type LogicalInputs = {
  assigned_seq?: Seq;
  logical_time?: number;
  entropy?: Array<{ id: string; bytes: string }>;
  external?: Array<{ id: string; value_hash: Hash; value?: WooValue }>;
};
```

Prototype route mapping:

| v1 runtime path | v2 `TurnCall.route` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directCall` that may mutate durable cells | `"committed"` | Shadow recorders may label this as `"direct"` until the commit plane exists. |
| `$space:call` / `$sequenced_log` applied call | `"committed"` | The existing space sequence is the prototype commit order. |
| Explicit preview/chat/presence-only path | `"live"` | Must not write durable object cells or create durable applied frames. |

Existing `$space` and `$sequenced_log` objects are valid prototype commit
scopes. A v1 sequenced space maps to the v2 `ScopeRef` for that space object.
Not every future commit scope must be a `$space`, but the prototype uses spaces
as the bridge because they already provide ordered applied frames.

The production `LogicalInputs` shape groups inputs by validation role. The
shadow recorder currently emits an ordered flat list of named inputs
(`Array<{name,value}>`) because that is the smallest replay mechanism. The
mapping is:

- `now`, `idle_seconds.now`, and substrate timestamp sites become
  `logical_time` inputs or named time entries under a future structured form;
- `random` becomes an `entropy` entry;
- admitted service or IO results become `external` entries.

Commit-plane implementations MUST preserve input order for replay even when
they also expose the grouped production form.

Committed turns MUST be deterministic given:

- the turn call;
- bytecode/source hashes;
- logical inputs;
- the validated read-set cell values;
- the selected commit-scope rules.

Committed turns MUST NOT read wall-clock time, host RNG, unsequenced external
IO, host-local enumeration order, or ambient state unless the input is admitted
through `LogicalInputs` or the read set.

Live turns are not replayed as durable history. They SHOULD still use the same
VM recorder in diagnostic mode so live/durable boundary mistakes are visible.

## VTN7. Effect transcript

An effect transcript is the canonical record submitted for commit validation
and replay.

```ts
type EffectTranscript = {
  kind: "woo.effect_transcript.v1";
  id: TurnId;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  base: ScopeHead;
  call: TurnCall;
  vm: {
    engine: string;
    catalog_hashes: Record<string, Hash>;
    verb_hashes: Record<string, Hash>;
  };
  inputs: LogicalInputs;
  reads: TranscriptRead[];
  writes: TranscriptWrite[];
  creates?: TranscriptCreate[];
  moves?: TranscriptMove[];
  recycles?: TranscriptRecycle[];
  schedules?: ScheduledTurnRequest[];      // defined in VTN18
  cancellations?: string[];                // schedule ids to cancel; defined in VTN18
  observations: WooObservation[];
  result?: WooValue;
  error?: WooError;
  complete: boolean;
  incomplete_reasons?: string[];
  pre_state_hash?: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
};

type TranscriptRead = {
  cell: CellRef;
  version: string;
  value_hash?: Hash;
  purpose?: "dispatch" | "permission" | "user" | "builtin" | "projection";
};

type TranscriptWrite = {
  cell: CellRef;
  prior?: string;
  value_hash: Hash;
  value?: WooValue;
  op: "set" | "delete" | "append" | "add" | "remove" | "move" | "replace" | "create";
  writer: RecordedWriteAuthority;
};

type TranscriptCreate = {
  object: ObjRef;
  parent: ObjRef;
  owner: ObjRef;
  initial_cells: TranscriptWrite[];
  writer: RecordedWriteAuthority;
};

type TranscriptMove = {
  object: ObjRef;
  from: ObjRef | null;
  to: ObjRef;
  writer: RecordedWriteAuthority;
};

type TranscriptRecycle = {
  object: ObjRef;
  final_version?: string;
};

type RecordedWriteAuthority = {
  progr: ObjRef;
  this_obj: ObjRef;
  verb: string;
  definer: ObjRef;
  caller: ObjRef;
  caller_perms: ObjRef;
};
```

`move` is used for location-cell replacement when containment movement is the
semantic operation. `add` and `remove` are used for contents-cell membership
updates. `create` is allowed only for lifecycle cells and SHOULD also be
represented in `creates` when the created object identity is visible.

Every mutation record MUST name the VM frame whose effective programmer
authority performed it. The commit scope validates that frame against recorded
dispatch/verb metadata reads, then checks property, movement, creation, and
lease authority for that single frame. It MUST NOT authorize a write by taking
the union of all verb owners mentioned anywhere in the transcript.

`complete: false` means the recorder observed an untracked native effect or an
execution boundary that cannot be validated. A commit scope MUST NOT accept an
incomplete transcript as a durable turn. It MAY store incomplete transcripts as
diagnostics. `incomplete_reasons` is a diagnostic annotation and is only
meaningful when `complete` is false.

Shadow v2 does not merge cross-host bridge sub-transcripts. When execution hits
a runtime host bridge such as dispatch, remote property access, movement, or
remote contents lookup, the recorder marks the caller transcript incomplete and
attaches a `woo.remote_bridge_transcript_policy.shadow.v1` diagnostic policy
value saying that sub-transcripts are deferred and the commit result is
`reject`. This is intentional: the prototype either executes a whole turn on
one capable node, or refuses to commit the partial local transcript. A later
execution-plane milestone may replace this diagnostic boundary with a signed
callee transcript that can be merged and validated by the caller's commit
scope.

The current implementation emits `kind: "woo.effect_transcript.shadow.v1"`.
That shadow shape is intentionally not wire-compatible with the production
`woo.effect_transcript.v1`: it may omit `base`, `vm`, `pre_state_hash`, and
`post_state_hash`; records logical inputs as a flat ordered list; and may carry
shadow-only incomplete-effect diagnostics. Shadow transcripts MUST NOT be
submitted as production commits. They may be converted by a later milestone once
a `ScopeHead`, accepted VM/catalog hashes, and pre/post state hashes are
available.

Dispatch reads SHOULD contribute to `vm.verb_hashes`. The shadow recorder
currently records the resolved definer, owner, version, `source_hash`,
direct-callability, native handler name when the verb is native, and the
handler's native primitive contract when one exists. It records both top-level
dispatches and local bytecode-to-bytecode calls so write-frame validation can
prove which verb frame performed each mutation. Production transcripts fold
that data into both the read set and the `vm` block.

Transcript values MAY be omitted when the receiver already has the matching
content-addressed state page. Validation still needs either the value or a
trusted way to retrieve it by `value_hash`.

Observation payloads are part of the transcript for committed turns. Live-only
events are not.

## VTN8. Commit plane

The commit plane orders accepted transcripts within one commit scope.

```ts
type LeaseToken = {
  kind: "woo.lease.v1";
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  holder: NodeRef | ActorRef;
  cells: CellRef[];
  mode: "write" | "sequence" | "migration";
  issued_at: number;
  expires_at: number;
  fence: string;
  signer: NodeRef | ScopeRef;
  signature?: string;
  mac?: string;
};

type ValidationRule = {
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  cells: CellRef[];
  purpose: "projection";
  max_staleness_seq?: number;
  max_staleness_ms?: number;
  verbs?: string[];
};

type CommitSubmit = {
  kind: "woo.commit.submit.v1";
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  expected: ScopeHead;
  transcript: EffectTranscript;
  leases?: LeaseToken[];
  requested_transfer?: TransferRequest; // defined in VTN12
};

type CommitAccepted = {
  kind: "woo.commit.accepted.v1";
  id: string;
  position: CommitPosition;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
  observations: WooObservation[];
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
  receipt: CommitReceipt;
};

type CommitConflict = {
  kind: "woo.commit.conflict.v1";
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  current: ScopeHead;
  reason:
    | "stale_head"
    | "read_version_mismatch"
    | "write_fence_missing"
    | "permission_denied"
    | "bytecode_mismatch"
    | "nondeterministic"
    | "incomplete_transcript"
    | "scope_mismatch";
  conflicting_cells?: CellRef[];
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
};

type CommitReceipt = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  seq: Seq;
  prev_hash: Hash;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
  signer: NodeRef | ScopeRef;
  signature?: string;
  mac?: string;
};
```

A commit scope validates a `CommitSubmit` in this order:

1. Envelope authentication and actor/session authority.
2. Scope and epoch match.
3. Idempotency key replay check.
4. Transcript is complete and targets this scope.
5. VM/catalog/verb hashes are accepted for the scope epoch.
6. Logical inputs are valid and not duplicated.
7. Read versions match current state, unless a declared validation rule allows
   the read to be stale projection data.
8. Permission reads and policy checks are included in the read set.
9. Writes are authorized by actor/session and any required lease/fence token.
10. Applying writes yields the transcript `post_state_hash`.
11. The receipt is recorded and returned.

If validation fails, no write from the transcript is committed. The executor may
catch up and retry the whole turn.

Lease acquisition is intentionally minimal in this draft: a commit scope or its
sequencer issues `LeaseToken`s for cells whose writes require fencing before the
turn runs. The token is not authority by itself; it is valid only with envelope
authentication and normal actor/session authorization.

Validation rules are scope-epoch policy, not caller hints. Until a
`ValidationRule` is installed for a scope epoch, projection reads are validated
with the same exact-version rule as semantic reads. The first implementation may
reject all stale projection reads while still carrying the type above for the
future relaxed path.

The shadow implementation now includes an in-process commit scope. It accepts
`woo.commit.submit.shadow.v1` messages from the execution helper, owns the
authoritative serialized state and shadow `ScopeHead`, validates expected head,
scope, completeness, session/actor shape, read versions, per-write VM-frame
authority, lifecycle/move post-state, and touched-cell post-state hashes, then
returns `woo.commit.accepted.shadow.v1` or `woo.commit.conflict.shadow.v1`.
The shadow submit no longer carries executor post-state. The commit scope
constructs authoritative post-state from transcript creates, writes, moves, and
sequenced-log outcome. Accepted frames carry commit position, transcript hash,
receipt, and observations; current projection state is derived from the commit
scope's authoritative serialized state or from explicit state transfers, never
from a per-frame full-world snapshot.

## VTN9. Catch-up and applied frames

Subscribers consume committed state through applied frames.

```ts
type Subscribe = {
  kind: "woo.subscribe.v1";
  scopes: ScopeRef[];
  from?: Record<ScopeRef, ScopeHead>;
  wants: "applied" | "projection" | "both";
};

type AppliedFrame = {
  kind: "woo.applied.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  position: CommitPosition;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  call?: TurnCall;
  observations: WooObservation[];
  result?: WooValue;       // only for authorized originator
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
};

type CatchupRequest = {
  kind: "woo.catchup.request.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  from: ScopeHead;
  limit?: number;
  wants?: "transcript" | "applied" | "projection";
};

type CatchupReply = {
  kind: "woo.catchup.reply.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  from: ScopeHead;
  to: ScopeHead;
  frames: AppliedFrame[];
  has_more: boolean;
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer; // projection fallback when delta tail is gone
};

type TransportError = {
  kind: "woo.transport.error.v1";
  code: string;
  message: string;
  envelope_id?: string;
};
```

`AppliedFrame` is the durable successor of the v1 `op:"applied"` frame. It is
the canonical subscription frame for committed observations and materialized
state changes. Clients MUST treat missing positions as gaps and use catch-up.
`Subscribe.wants` uses `"both"` because a subscription can stream applied
frames and projection updates together. `CatchupRequest.wants` uses
`"transcript"` instead because catch-up may explicitly ask for audit/replay
material rather than display projection.

After a browser reconnects, it MUST NOT assume the relay buffered frames while
the socket was absent. For every subscribed scope, the browser sends
`CatchupRequest { from: last_known_scope_head, wants: "applied" }` or
`wants:"projection"` when it only needs display state. If the relay still has a
contiguous applied-frame tail after `from`, it returns frames and the new
`to` head. If the relay no longer has the tail, or `from.epoch` is stale, the
relay replies with `frames: []`, `has_more: false`, and `state_transfer` in
projection mode. The browser then replaces its display projection for that
scope and treats the returned `to` head as the new catch-up base.

Relays MAY buffer accepted frames for connected sockets to smooth short
network stalls, but browser correctness MUST come from catch-up plus state
transfer. A reconnecting browser therefore follows this order:

1. reopen the WebSocket and authenticate the session;
2. resubscribe to desired scopes with its last known `ScopeHead`s;
3. request deltas from those heads;
4. fall back to projection state transfer when a delta tail is unavailable;
5. discard optimistic browser-local state that cannot be reconciled to the new
   head.

## VTN10. Execution plane

Execution RPC asks another node to execute a whole turn. The request target is a
node believed to be a capable executor, not an object's permanent home.

```ts
type TurnKey = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  atoms: string[];
  write_atoms?: string[];
  accept_atoms?: string[];
  effects: number;
};

type TurnExecRequest = {
  kind: "woo.turn.exec.v1";
  id: TurnId;
  turn: TurnCall & { route: "committed" };
  scope: ScopeRef;
  caller_head: ScopeHead;
  predicted: TurnKey;
  required_consistency: "presentation" | "semantic" | "write";
  requested_transfer?: TransferRequest; // defined in VTN12
  max_transfer_bytes?: number;
  selected_ad?: string;
  commit_policy?: "execute_and_commit" | "execute_only";
};

type TurnExecReply =
  | {
      kind: "woo.turn.exec.reply.v1";
      ok: true;
      id: TurnId;
      outcome: { result?: WooValue; error?: WooError };
      transcript: EffectTranscript;
      commit?: CommitAccepted;
      state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
      ads?: ExecCapabilityAd[];
    }
  | {
      kind: "woo.turn.exec.reply.v1";
      ok: false;
      id: TurnId;
      reason:
        | "missing_state"
        | "stale_head"
        | "scope_mismatch"
        | "busy"
        | "policy_denied"
        | "ad_expired"
        | "transfer_too_large"
        | "not_deterministic";
      missing_atoms?: string[];
      current?: ScopeHead;
      better_ad?: ExecCapabilityAd;
      state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
    };
```

The default `commit_policy` is `execute_and_commit`. A successful default reply
MUST include an accepted commit receipt. `execute_only` is reserved for local
simulation and diagnostic deployments; clients MUST NOT treat an `execute_only`
result as authoritative state.

Turn-exec replies and accepted frames MUST NOT carry a full serialized
post-state. Current committed state is owned by the commit scope, and browser
state reaches clients through state-plane projection/delta transfers. Wire
replies carry commit position, transcript hash, receipt, and observations.

`atoms` are the state/code/metadata closure that a candidate must probably
cover before execution. `write_atoms` identify write-authority-sensitive cells
so routing can avoid projection-only nodes before commit. `accept_atoms` are
the compact turn-shape atoms, typically scope/target/call, checked against an
ad's `accepts` filter.

An executor SHOULD refuse before running the VM if required atoms are obviously
missing. If missing state is discovered during execution, the executor MUST
abort without commit and return `missing_state`. Partial transcripts from such
runs are diagnostics only.

The shadow implementation covers this for fresh `TurnCall` execution in two
places: a predicted TurnKey is compared with a local atom cache before running,
and the turn recorder enforces an `E_NEED_STATE` guard when dispatch, property,
or structural cell events touch an atom outside the materialized set. The
recorded-turn replay helper remains a diagnostic preflight harness only.

The `executeShadowRecordedTurnOrNeedState` helper is a diagnostic replay
harness: it accepts an already recorded turn and replays it with recorded
logical inputs. The newer `executeShadowTurnCallOrNeedState` helper follows the
target protocol shape more closely: it receives a `TurnCall`, executes it fresh
on the selected node, returns a shadow `TurnExecReply`, and can submit the fresh
transcript to the in-process shadow commit scope for accept/conflict handling.

## VTN11. Capability gossip

Capability ads are compact routing hints.

```ts
type Bloom = {
  m: number;              // number of bits
  k: number;              // number of hash functions
  salt_id?: string;
  bits: string;           // base64url bitset
};

type ExecCapabilityAd = {
  kind: "woo.exec.ad.v1";
  ad: string;
  node: NodeRef;
  expires_at: number;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  head: ScopeHead;
  covers: Bloom;
  accepts: Bloom;
  effects: number;
  factor: number;
  max_transfer_bytes?: number;
  auth?: AuthContext;
};
```

`covers` means "this node probably has the state, code, metadata, and log tail."
`accepts` means "this node is willing to run this target/verb/scope shape."

Nodes MUST NOT encode device class, battery state, permanence tier, or platform
kind as protocol categories. Low-capability or low-permanence nodes simply do
not advertise, or they advertise narrowly with a worse opaque `factor`.

Candidate selection:

```text
ad not expired
ad.scope and ad.epoch match the TurnKey
all TurnKey atoms are probably in ad.covers
turn-shape atoms are probably in ad.accepts
TurnKey effects are a subset of ad.effects
rank by observed latency + ad.factor + estimated transfer cost + failure penalty
```

Lower rank scores are better. `factor` is an opaque cost contribution, not a
quality score; a larger factor makes an otherwise equivalent candidate less
preferred.

Ads are advisory. Commit receipts and state proofs are authoritative.

When an ad is carried inside an `Envelope`, omitted `ExecCapabilityAd.auth`
means the ad inherits `Envelope.auth`. When an ad is relayed or stored outside
its original envelope, `auth` MUST be present unless the ad is explicitly
`anonymous_advisory` and confined to a trusted local link. An absent `auth`
never upgrades an ad to same-deployment authority.

Prototype profiling SHOULD treat stale ads and Bloom false positives as normal
events, not exceptional failures. A failed execution attempt that returns
`missing_state` contributes observed latency and a failure penalty to future
ranking, then the caller falls back to another ad or state transfer. The ad
plane remains advisory; correctness still comes from transcript validation and
commit receipts.

## VTN12. State plane

State transfer fills execution and display caches. It does not grant write
authority.

```ts
type TransferRequest = {
  mode: "projection" | "delta" | "closure";
  base?: ScopeHead;
  max_bytes?: number;
  atoms?: string[];
};

type StateTransfer = {
  kind: "woo.state.transfer.v1";
  mode: "projection" | "delta" | "closure";
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  base?: ScopeHead;
  to?: ScopeHead;
  pages?: StatePageRef[];
  inline_pages?: StatePage[];
  transcript_tail?: EffectTranscript[];
  applied?: AppliedFrame[];
  projection?: WooValue;
  proof?: StateProof;
};

type StatePageRef = {
  hash: Hash;
  bytes?: number;
  uri?: string;
};

type StatePage = {
  hash: Hash;
  codec: "canonical-json" | "cbor";
  bytes: string;          // base64url
};

type StateProof = {
  root: Hash;
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  epoch?: Epoch;
  seq?: Seq;
  receipt?: CommitReceipt;
};
```

Transfer modes:

- `projection`: enough for display and command planning, not authoritative
  execution unless marked as a semantic read by a later committed turn;
- `delta`: applied frames or transcript tail since a known head;
- `closure`: executable state bundle for a predicted turn, including cells,
  parent/feature/verb metadata, bytecode hashes, and permission facts.

The shadow transfer implementation uses
`kind: "woo.state.transfer.shadow.v1"`. It still supports `mode: "closure"`
with a full serialized pre-turn world for diagnostic replay and
`mode: "object_records"` as a compatibility fallback, but the default fresh-call
network path now uses `mode: "cell_pages"`. A cell-page transfer is selected
from missing TurnKey atom preimages and carries reusable content-addressed
pages:

- `object_lineage`: object identity, parent, owner, flags, anchor, and schemas;
- `object_live`: location, children, and contents cells;
- `property_cell`: one property definition/value/version cell;
- `verb_bytecode`: one verb implementation cell.

The transfer also carries the session/log/counter envelope data needed to
execute the turn in a small shard. Page refs can be advertised from cache; only
unknown pages are inlined. Install verifies inline pages against their
advertised page hashes and verifies a shadow MAC proof scoped to an anchor
authority and recipient node. This is not production authorization yet, but it
proves that state transfer can be driven by exact post-selection inventory gaps
instead of copying the whole world or even whole object records.

The shadow browser relay also implements `mode: "projection"` and
`mode: "delta"` for display/cache catch-up. Opening a scope installs a
projection transfer instead of directly mutating the browser projection cache.
After an accepted commit, the relay sends delta transfers only to browser nodes
subscribed to that commit scope; other browser nodes learn the new head through
later state transfer. A shadow delta transfer carries the accepted frame, a
transcript tail, and a refreshed projection.

The M4 shadow projection body is `kind: "woo.scope_projection.shadow.v1"`.
It is catalog-neutral display/cache state, not executable authority. It MUST
name the `scope`, current `seq`, a `cursor.spaces[scope].next_seq`, the visible
`subject` summary when available, and an `objects` array containing only the
generic neighborhood the browser can display or use for command planning:
subject, subject contents, viewer actor, viewer inventory, and viewer current
location contents. When viewer context is available, it also carries generic
`self`, `session`, and `inventory` fields shaped like the scoped HTTP
projection. Object summaries use the same generic fields as the scoped HTTP
projection (`id`, `name`, `parent`, `ancestors`, `owner`, `location`, and
readable `props`) and MUST NOT depend on bundled catalog object identities.
Catalog-specific UI state is derived by catalog UI code from readable props and
observation schemas; the browser worker stores the projection opaquely.

Browser projection/delta transfers use proof scheme `shadow.relay_mac.v1`.
The proof root is a canonical hash over mode, scope, recipient, target head,
projection, accepted-frame ids/positions/transcript hashes/post-state hashes,
and transcript-tail hashes. The proof also carries authority, key id,
recipient, and a MAC signature over the root. Receivers MUST verify the
recipient binding, trusted relay authority, MAC signature, and transcript
body-to-hash equality before installing projection/delta cache. This scheme is
shadow-local relay authority, distinct from the execution-plane
`shadow.anchor_mac.v1` object-record proof.

Shadow latency profiles report bytes for the cell-page closure and the
object-record closure so later page/cell-bounded work has concrete performance
targets. The current profile also reports a two-turn warmup: after one dubspace
control turn installs lineage pages, a second control turn for the same object
can transfer page refs with no inline records. A node preseeded with
catalog/class pages can likewise materialize those records from cache and
inline only live instance pages on its first turn.

Receivers MUST verify page hashes and proofs before installing cache. Receivers
MUST apply authorization filtering before exposing transferred values to a
browser, actor, or agent.

## VTN13. Live plane

Live events are low-latency, non-durable messages. They are not replayed through
catch-up and they do not advance a commit-scope sequence.

```ts
type LiveEvent = {
  kind: "woo.live.event.v1";
  id: string;
  source: ObjRef;
  actor?: ActorRef;
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  audience?: {
    actors?: ActorRef[];
    sessions?: SessionRef[];
    scope?: ScopeRef;
  };
  observation: WooObservation;
  coalesce?: string;
};
```

On the wire, `LiveEvent` is carried in an `Envelope<LiveEvent>` with
`type:"woo.live.event.v1"`, `v:2`, and `auth.mode:"session"` for
browser-originated events. Live events are not commit authority, but they are
still session-authenticated because they can affect other users' displays,
audio engines, or presence views.

`coalesce` is a sender-chosen ASCII key with grammar:

```text
coalesce-key = scope "/" source "/" channel [ "/" field ]
```

Each segment is a URL-safe token (`[A-Za-z0-9._~-]+`) after object ids or field
names are escaped. The key is scoped to `(session or actor, scope)` by the
relay. Relays MAY keep only the newest live event for the same coalesce key
under backpressure.

Live event decoders MUST reject payloads that attempt to carry durable writes.
The **durability-reserved envelope fields** are `writes`, `creates`, `moves`,
`transcript`, `commit`, `receipt`, `state_transfer`, `applied`, `schedule`, and
`cancellations`. In the M4 JSON profile, a live event body MUST NOT contain any
durability-reserved envelope field. Future durable payload shapes MUST either
extend this named set or explain why the field is safe on the live plane. Live
observations also MUST NOT use catalog observation types reserved for committed
durable changes unless the catalog marks that observation schema
`live: true`, as defined in catalogs CT5.5. A rejected live event is dropped
and MAY be reported to the sender as a protocol error; it MUST NOT be converted
into a commit request.

Live events cover:

- direct chat lines and tells that are intentionally not durable;
- dubspace slider/cursor/gesture previews;
- transient presence hints;
- UI-specific ephemeral signals.

Live event delivery is best-effort. Relays MAY drop or coalesce live events
under backpressure. Durable changes MUST use the commit plane instead.

Catalog verbs that are callable through the live plane MUST be declared as
live/direct safe. A live/direct-safe verb:

- may emit live observations;
- may read authorized projection or semantic state;
- may update ephemeral session/browser-local state;
- MUST NOT write durable object cells;
- MUST NOT create, recycle, or move durable objects;
- MUST NOT rely on its live execution for future replay.

## VTN14. Browser node

A browser node is a v2 node running inside a browser, normally as a Web Worker.
It is not just a renderer.

Required browser-node components:

- worker-hosted VM/runtime subset;
- IndexedDB cache for state pages, projections, transcript tails, and pending
  turns;
- WebSocket connection to a session relay;
- subscription client for applied frames and projections;
- live-plane sender/receiver for chat, cursors, and gesture previews;
- commit submitter for tentative local transcripts;
- reconciliation layer for accepted/conflicted turns;
- state-page and receipt verifier.

Initial browser-node authority:

- MAY execute deterministic committed turns locally for the authenticated actor
  when it has an authorized closure;
- MAY submit transcripts to a server-side commit scope;
- MAY emit live events allowed by session policy;
- MAY receive only authorized projections/closures;
- MUST NOT commit without server-side validation;
- MUST NOT advertise broad `ExecCapabilityAd`s;
- MAY advertise a narrow session-local capability to its relay in later
  milestones.

Browser-node board edit flow:

```text
UI -> worker: move_pin(pin, x, y)
worker: build TurnKey and verify local closure
worker: run tentative VM turn and record transcript
worker -> relay/commit scope: CommitSubmit
commit scope -> worker: CommitAccepted or CommitConflict
worker -> UI: confirm, patch-forward, or report conflict
```

Shadow implementation status: the in-process prototype includes a
browser-shaped node/relay shim with an object-page cache, scope projection
cache, pending-turn table, accepted/conflict frame queues, and transfer
tracking. Scope open uses a shadow projection transfer, accepted commits fan
out to subscribed browser nodes as shadow delta transfers carrying the accepted
frame, transcript tail, and refreshed projection, and relay MAC proofs are
verified before cache install. The shim also includes scope subscriptions and
best-effort live-event fan-out with coalescing, without advancing the
commit-scope head. Relay and browser diagnostic tails are bounded in the shadow
implementation; if a browser reconnects from a head older than the retained
tail, it receives a projection fallback rather than an unbounded replay. The
browser-side M4 worker opens the v2 WebSocket, persists
hello/reply/pending-frame state in IndexedDB, applies received projection/delta
state transfers into projection, applied-frame, and transcript-tail stores,
persists executable object/state pages from closure transfers, replays pending
envelopes after reconnect, and marks reset/catch-up-needed state when the relay
reports reset. The browser worker bundles into the SPA on every deployment but,
on the legacy namespace, runs silently alongside the v1 `/ws` UI: it persists
state into IndexedDB for soak-testing the wire path without driving rendering
unless the explicit `v2AppliedFrames` flag is present. UI migration to consume
v2 committed state directly is deferred until at least one catalog is
v2-authoritative on that namespace.

M4 wire-slice status: local dev and the Cloudflare Worker expose the reserved
`POST /v2/session/mint` path and `GET /v2/turn-network/ws` WebSocket endpoint.
The endpoint validates the `woo-v2.turn-network.json` subprotocol, sends a v2
`TransportHello` envelope followed by an initial projection/delta state-transfer
envelope, decodes subsequent frames through the shared shadow envelope codec,
and can return shadow execution replies. Reconnect opens may include the
browser's cached `last_known_head` so `CommitScopeDO` can return a retained
delta instead of a full projection when the tail is still available. The Worker gateway
forwards authority-bearing v2 envelopes to `CommitScopeDO`, which persists the
shadow commit scope, accepted-frame tail, transcript tail, seen idempotency
keys, and cached replies in row-shaped storage. Fresh envelopes write only the
new idempotency key/reply and accepted commit delta; duplicate envelopes replay
the cached reply without another durable write. Gateway isolate hibernation no
longer resets v2 commit authority; browsers still resubscribe and run VTN9
catch-up after any transport reconnect because live socket subscriptions remain
connection-local. The local dev server keeps the earlier socket-lifetime
in-process relay shim.

The first production deployment of this wire path targets a separate
namespace where v1 compatibility is not maintained. On that namespace, MCP is
the first v2 consumer: McpGateway is a pure v2 client for world/object verb
calls (single durable observation source, commit traffic through
`/v2/envelope`), while MCP queue/focus controls remain local protocol state.
The legacy production namespace stays on v1 unchanged; browsers and v1 MCP
clients continue to use it. See
[notes/2026-05-13-mcp-first-v2.md](../../notes/2026-05-13-mcp-first-v2.md)
for the migration plan and namespace strategy.

Browser-node dubspace preview flow:

```text
UI -> worker: preview_control(target, name, value)
worker -> local audio: apply preview immediately
worker -> relay live plane: LiveEvent(gesture_progress)
relay -> subscribers: best-effort LiveEvent
```

Browser-node dubspace commit flow:

```text
UI -> worker: set_control(target, name, value)
worker: run deterministic turn and record transcript
worker -> commit scope: CommitSubmit
commit scope -> subscribers: AppliedFrame(control_changed)
browser audio engines apply the committed frame
```

## VTN15. Functional parity requirements

The first implementation that claims v2 protocol support MUST pass parity
scenarios for the existing bundled workloads.

### Chat

- actors enter, leave, move, take, drop, and observe room activity;
- direct speech/tells are low-latency live events;
- containment changes and take/drop conflicts are committed in canonical order;
- transparent chat embedded in pinboard/dubspace forwards as specified by the
  catalog.

### Pinboard and kanban

- notes/cards remain first-class objects;
- board layout, z-order, columns, and card order are durable committed state;
- composite verbs such as `add_note` and `add_card` are atomic turns;
- viewers receive applied frames for durable board changes;
- board mini-chat remains live-only unless a durable chat feature is installed;
- large boards can be opened through projection before full closure transfer.

Prototype status: browser-shim coverage currently commits pinboard
`add_note`, `move_pin`, `resize_pin`, pin `set_color`, `set_text`, `take`,
and `drop`, plus taskspace `create_task`, task `claim`, and task
`set_status`. Same-turn object creation is validated against transcript
create/write facts rather than the pre-turn world. Deterministic native helpers
are admitted only when a `woo.native_primitive_contract.shadow.v1` contract
declares the handler transcript-tracked and deterministic, including the state
families it reads, writes, and emits. Native dispatches without such a contract
make the transcript incomplete. Runtime cross-host bridge boundaries are also
explicitly incomplete in the shadow protocol; mergeable remote sub-transcripts
are deferred until the execution plane exists.

### Dubspace

- high-rate slider/cursor previews use the live plane;
- final control changes, transport, tempo, patterns, and scene operations commit
  through the commit plane;
- browser audio engines apply both live previews and accepted committed frames;
- logical time replaces wall-clock reads for persistent transport state.

## VTN16. Prototype milestones

The prototype SHOULD land in this order:

1. Turn recorder and replay/diff in the current runtime.
2. In-process multi-node simulator with execution, commit, state, and live
   planes.
3. Content-addressed state transfer and fixed Bloom ad profile.
4. Browser-node worker with IndexedDB cache and relay transport.
5. Networked infrastructure nodes, anchors, and disposable executors.
6. Eviction, cold activation, transcript compaction, and chaos tests.

The first milestone is successful when chat, pinboard, and dubspace committed
turns produce complete replayable transcripts, and live-only interactions are
classified as live rather than smuggled durable mutation.

## VTN17. Open decisions before production

Prototype implementation may proceed before these are fully settled, but a
production v2 spec needs decisions on:

- final binary encoding and compression;
- transcript retention and compaction policy;
- exact lease/fence requirements by cell kind;
- Bloom sizing and salt rotation;
- cross-operator signature policy;
- contested-scope promotion/demotion rules;
- browser optimistic-conflict UX;
- catalog update sequencing relative to ordinary turns;
- privacy profile for projection/state transfer to agents.

## VTN18. Scheduled turns (draft/proposed)

> Status: **proposed**. This section describes how catalog code arranges for
> periodic committed turns without a global clock. It extends the `EffectTranscript`
> from VTN7 with `schedules` and `cancellations` arrays, defines a
> `ScopeTimeAdvance` control frame for the commit plane, and specifies the
> logical-time advancement rule precisely. Not yet implemented.

### VTN18.1 Motivation

Most Woo verbs are reactive — they run when a user or agent calls them. Some
catalog behavior is inherently time-driven: a dubspace transport advancing its
playhead, a game loop advancing physics, a timer firing after a delay. In
Croquet this is expressed as `this.future(16).step()`, which the reflector
delivers to all peers at the correct logical time. Woo v2 has no global
reflector, but the commit scope for a space already owns a sequenced log and a
logical time. A scope-local equivalent of `future()` can be built from that
without a global dependency.

A scheduled turn is a committed turn that will happen later. It is recorded in
the scheduling transcript as a first-class output (parallel to `creates` and
`observations`), stored in the scope's durable pending queue, and fired by the
scope's infrastructure when the scope's logical time reaches the target.

### VTN18.2 ScheduledTurnRequest and transcript extension

`ScheduledTurnRequest` carries a full authority context so the commit scope can
validate the scheduled turn exactly as it would validate a live-submitted one.

```ts
type ScheduledTurnRequest = {
  kind:            "woo.scheduled_turn_request.v1";
  id:              string;       // caller-chosen stable key; see VTN18.3
  scope:           ScopeRef;     // MUST match the current commit scope
  epoch:           Epoch;        // MUST match scope epoch; stale entries cancelled
  at_logical_time: number;       // absolute delivery target; > turn's logical_time
  call: {
    actor:        ActorRef;      // actor on whose behalf the turn fires
    target:       ObjRef;
    verb:         string;
    args:         WooValue[];
    caller_perms: ObjRef;        // progr at schedule time; bounds permission checks
    route:        "committed";
  };
  authority:
    | { kind: "scheduling_actor" }
    // actor and caller_perms above are sufficient; commit scope validates
    // permissions against live actor state at delivery time.
    | { kind: "service_actor"; actor: ActorRef }
    // Fire as a declared service actor regardless of who scheduled it.
    // Requires the scheduling turn's actor to hold the delegation capability.
};
```

`ScheduledTurnRequest` entries appear in the `schedules` array of
`EffectTranscript` (VTN7 fields added here):

```ts
// Extension to EffectTranscript (VTN7):
schedules?:     ScheduledTurnRequest[];
cancellations?: string[];   // schedule ids to remove from pending queue
```

`schedules` and `cancellations` are **not** `TranscriptWrite` entries. They
MUST NOT be represented with a fabricated `op` value. They are parallel to
`creates` and `recycles`: named, typed arrays with their own validation path.
Both arrays are included in the `post_state_hash` preimage because the pending
queue is durable scope state.

Commit scope validation for `schedules`:

- `scope` MUST match the current commit scope; reject otherwise.
- `epoch` MUST match the current scope epoch.
- `at_logical_time` MUST be strictly greater than the scheduling turn's
  assigned `logical_time`.
- `id` is an **upsert key**: if a pending entry with the same `id` already
  exists it is replaced atomically; otherwise the new entry is inserted. This
  allows `start_ticking` to re-arm an existing chain without explicit
  cancellation (see VTN18.7).
- For `authority.kind = "service_actor"`: the scheduling actor MUST hold the
  delegation capability for the named service actor.

Commit scope validation for `cancellations`:

- Each `id` removes the matching pending entry if one exists; cancelling a
  non-existent id is a no-op.
- `cancellations` and `schedules` are applied atomically. An `id` that appears
  in both arrays in the same transcript is rejected.

### VTN18.3 DSL builtin: `schedule` and `cancel_schedule`

```
schedule(target, verb, args, delay_ms)           // turn-unique id
schedule(target, verb, args, delay_ms, id: key)  // stable caller-supplied id

cancel_schedule(id)                              // appends id to cancellations[]
```

The two forms of `schedule()` differ only in id derivation:

- **Turn-unique**: `id = deterministic_hash(turn_id, per_turn_counter)`. Each
  call within one turn gets a distinct id; stable across replays. Use for
  one-shot deferred calls.
- **Stable-key**: `id = key` as supplied. The commit scope upserts: an existing
  pending entry with this id is replaced. Use for periodic self-rescheduling
  chains (see VTN18.7).

`at_logical_time` is computed before recording:

```
at_logical_time = current_logical_time + delay_ms
```

No floor adjustment is performed by the builtin. The minimum-interval floor is
enforced by the commit scope at delivery time (see VTN18.5). The transcript
records exactly what the verb requested; the scope decides when it is safe to
deliver.

`schedule()` is same-scope only. It MUST NOT target a different scope. Cross-scope
scheduling requires a separate committed turn submitted through normal channels.

### VTN18.4 Logical-time advancement and due-turn delivery

The commit scope maintains two durable state fields:

```
scope.logical_time:  number
scope.pending_queue: ScheduledTurnRequest[]   // sorted by (at_logical_time, id)
```

Both contribute to `post_state_hash`.

**Assignment rule for all committed turns:**

```
scope.logical_time ← max(scope.logical_time + 1, inputs.logical_time)
```

The commit scope assigns `inputs.logical_time` for each turn it accepts. For
interactive turns the scope assigns `scope.logical_time + 1`. The monotonic
increment ensures that no two accepted turns share a `logical_time`.

**Due-turn delivery order:**

After advancing `scope.logical_time`, the commit scope fires all pending entries
with `at_logical_time <= scope.logical_time`, in order `(at_logical_time ASC,
id ASC)`. Each fired turn advances `scope.logical_time` by at least 1 before the
next one fires. Turns sharing an `at_logical_time` are therefore delivered in `id`
order with consecutive sequence numbers.

**Heartbeat via ScopeTimeAdvance:**

When the pending queue is non-empty and no interactive turns arrive, the scope's
infrastructure node sends a `ScopeTimeAdvance` control frame to trigger delivery:

```ts
type ScopeTimeAdvance = {
  kind:       "woo.scope.time_advance.v1";
  scope:      ScopeRef;
  epoch:      Epoch;
  expected:   ScopeHead;   // MUST match current scope head; prevents races
  advance_to: number;      // MUST be > scope.logical_time
};

type ScopeTimeAdvanced = {
  kind:     "woo.scope.time_advanced.v1";
  scope:    ScopeRef;
  position: CommitPosition;  // scope head after advancing and firing due turns
  fired:    TurnId[];        // ids of scheduled turns submitted as a result
};
```

`ScopeTimeAdvance` is a **commit-scope control frame**, not a `TurnCall`. It
has no `target`, no `verb`, no VM execution, and produces no `EffectTranscript`.
Processing: validate epoch and expected head; advance `scope.logical_time` to
`advance_to`; fire all due entries in order; return `ScopeTimeAdvanced`.

The heartbeat stops when the pending queue empties. For Cloudflare DO commit
scopes, the DO Durable Alarm replaces an external heartbeat driver: the DO sets
its alarm to the earliest `at_logical_time` in the queue and wakes itself to send
`ScopeTimeAdvance` when the alarm fires.

### VTN18.5 Minimum delivery interval

The commit scope enforces a minimum interval between consecutive deliveries of
the same `(target, verb)` pair. Default floor: 16 ms. The floor may be raised
per scope configuration; it may not be lowered below 1 ms.

The floor is applied at delivery time, not at recording time. The commit scope
tracks `last_delivered_at[(target, verb)]`. When a due entry would fire within
`last_delivered_at + min_tick_ms`, it is deferred to `last_delivered_at + min_tick_ms`
in the pending queue. The recorded `at_logical_time` in the transcript is not
changed; the `inputs.logical_time` assigned by the scope at actual delivery may
be later. Catalog code receives the floor rate when it requests faster ticks;
no error is returned.

### VTN18.6 Epoch migration

When the scope epoch is fenced:

- All pending entries with a stale `epoch` are cancelled.
- Any in-flight `ScopeTimeAdvance` carrying a stale epoch is rejected.
- Catalog code that needs periodic execution after epoch migration must
  re-register. The `$tick_source` pattern handles this through the
  `scope_resumed` observation described in VTN18.7.

### VTN18.7 Catalog pattern: `$tick_source`

Informative, not normative. `$tick_source` uses the stable-key form of
`schedule()` so that `start_ticking` is idempotent: calling it while a chain
is already running replaces the existing pending entry rather than creating a
duplicate.

```
feature $tick_source {
  prop tick_ms   default 100;
  prop ticking   default false;

  // Stable key derived from object identity, not turn id.
  prop _tick_key = hash("tick_source:" + this.id + ":_tick");

  verb :start_ticking(rate_ms) rxd {
    this.tick_ms = rate_ms;
    this.ticking = true;
    schedule(this, "_tick", [], rate_ms, id: this._tick_key);
  }

  verb :stop_ticking() rxd {
    this.ticking = false;
    cancel_schedule(this._tick_key);
  }

  // Delivered by commit scope infrastructure; do not call directly.
  verb :_tick() rxd {
    if !this.ticking { return; }
    call(this, "tick");
    schedule(this, "_tick", [], this.tick_ms, id: this._tick_key);
  }

  // Re-arm after epoch migration. Subscribe to scope_resumed observation
  // (type TBD in catalog model) and call this handler.
  verb :_on_scope_resumed() rxd {
    if this.ticking {
      schedule(this, "_tick", [], this.tick_ms, id: this._tick_key);
    }
  }
}
```

### VTN18.8 Authority at delivery time

The commit scope constructs a `TurnCall` from the `ScheduledTurnRequest.call`
fields at delivery and validates it as it would any actor-submitted turn:

```ts
{
  id:     scheduled_entry.id + "@" + String(scope.logical_time),
  actor:  scheduled_entry.call.actor,   // or service_actor for service authority
  target: scheduled_entry.call.target,
  verb:   scheduled_entry.call.verb,
  args:   scheduled_entry.call.args,
  caller: "$system",   // indicates infrastructure delivery
  route:  "committed"
}
```

Permission checks run against live world state at delivery time, not at
schedule time. If the actor no longer holds the required permission the turn
produces an error frame and the pending entry is removed. Failed scheduled turns
are not retried automatically; catalog code must re-register if it wants retry
behavior.

### VTN18.9 Queue storage

The pending schedule queue is **durable commit-scope state**:

- Stored alongside the sequenced log head in the scope's durable storage.
- Its serialized content is included in the `post_state_hash` preimage.
- On cold activation the queue is loaded from durable storage. Entries overdue
  at activation time fire on the next `ScopeTimeAdvance` or interactive turn.
- For Cloudflare DO commit scopes: serialized into DO storage alongside the log
  head; the DO Durable Alarm drives delivery, replacing any external heartbeat.

### VTN18.10 Live vs. committed ticks

| Behavior | Plane | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Dubspace slider/cursor previews | Live | High-rate, lossy-ok, display only |
| Pattern step advance, loop boundary | Committed | Must be ordered, reproducible |
| Transport `playing_since` / position write | Committed | Durable mutation, must replay |
| Visual animation interpolation in browser | Browser-local | Ephemeral display state |
| Presence heartbeat | Live | Best-effort |

A committed tick is a full transcript with a state hash and receipt. At 60 Hz
that is ~60 committed turns per second, appropriate only when state changes at
that rate and those changes must survive replay.

### VTN18.11 Open questions

- **Maximum queue depth.** A cap on pending entries per scope prevents
  queue-hoarding; 1000 entries per scope is a plausible default.
- **Scheduled turns and TurnKey routing.** Scheduled turns are submitted by the
  commit scope infrastructure, bypassing capability-ad routing. The scope node
  is always the executor; actor-node optimistic execution of scheduled turns is
  deferred.
- **`scope_resumed` observation.** The system observation type that `$tick_source`
  subscribes to for epoch-migration recovery is not yet defined in the catalog
  model.

## VTN19. Transport bindings

VTN19 defines the M4 browser-to-relay transport binding. It is intentionally
narrow: one browser node, one relay, one WebSocket, JSON envelopes only.
Node-node transport, binary page transfer, `same_deployment_mac`, and
cross-deployment signatures are deferred to M5.
Transport is foundational to all four planes, but this section lives after the
turn/state/live definitions so its message names can refer to those sections.

### VTN19.1 WebSocket endpoint and open handshake

Authority-bearing v2 browser-relay connections MUST use `wss://`. `ws://` is
permitted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]` development endpoints.

The browser opens:

```text
GET /v2/turn-network/ws?token=<session-token>&node=<browser-node-id>&scope=<scope-ref?>&last_known_head=<json-scope-head?>&resume=<resume-token?>
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: woo-v2.turn-network.json
```

The token in the query string is allowed only for the opening handshake. After
the socket is established, every envelope repeats the bearer token in
`auth.token` as specified in VTN4.2. Deployments that log URLs MUST redact the
`token` query parameter.

`scope` and `last_known_head` are the M4 shadow binding's open-handshake
catch-up shortcut for a single scope. When present, `last_known_head` is a JSON
encoded `ScopeHead` for `scope`; the relay validates the shape, treats malformed
or stale values as absent, and sends the state transfer that VTN9 would have
returned for that cursor. Relays with retained contiguous history SHOULD send a
delta transfer; otherwise they send a projection transfer. This shortcut does
not replace explicit `Subscribe`/`CatchupRequest` for multi-scope clients.

The relay MUST select `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: woo-v2.turn-network.json` or
reject the upgrade with HTTP 400. A server that accepts the WebSocket without
selecting that subprotocol is not a conforming M4 v2 relay.

The relay's first message MUST be:

```ts
type TransportHello = {
  kind: "woo.transport.hello.v1";
  relay: NodeRef;
  session: SessionRef;
  actor: ActorRef;
  server_time: number;
  max_message_bytes: number;
  idempotency_window_ms: number;
  planes: Array<"execution" | "commit" | "state" | "live">;
  resume_token?: string;
  features: string[];
};
```

The browser MUST NOT send authority-bearing envelopes until it receives
`TransportHello`. If authentication fails before `TransportHello`, the relay
MUST close the WebSocket with a policy/auth failure reason. The relay MAY accept
idempotent `ping` control frames before hello only to keep intermediaries from
closing a slow-auth connection.

After `TransportHello`, an M4 shadow relay SHOULD immediately send the
projection or delta `woo.state.transfer.shadow.v1` for the opened `scope` before
processing authority-bearing browser envelopes. This preserves hello-first
transport semantics while ensuring browser caches install verified state before
pending turns are replayed.

`TransportHello.actor` is the relay-validated actor from the session token. If
it differs from the browser's cached actor, the browser MUST treat
`TransportHello.actor` as authoritative and discard local state bound to the
previous actor.

### VTN19.2 Plane multiplexing

The M4 browser-relay binding multiplexes all four protocol planes on the single
WebSocket. Plane is derived from the envelope `type`:

| Type prefix | Plane |
|---|---|
| `woo.turn.exec.` | Execution |
| `woo.commit.` | Commit |
| `woo.state.` and `woo.catchup.` | State |
| `woo.subscribe.` | State/control |
| `woo.live.` | Live |
| `woo.transport.` | Transport control |

Messages from different planes MAY be interleaved. Receivers MUST preserve
per-envelope idempotency by `(from, id)` and MUST preserve commit-scope order
by `ScopeHead`, not by WebSocket arrival order. A relay MUST NOT let a live
message overtake or rewrite durable committed state; if a live event and an
applied frame affect the same display field, the browser's projection rules
decide which layer is visible.

If a browser sends an envelope whose derived plane is not in
`TransportHello.planes`, the relay MUST reply with `woo.transport.error.v1` and
MAY close the socket. This is a protocol error, not an unknown-message no-op.

### VTN19.3 Ping, idle, and backpressure

Either endpoint MAY use WebSocket ping/pong frames. In addition, either endpoint
MAY send:

```ts
type TransportPing = {
  kind: "woo.transport.ping.v1";
  now: number;
};

type TransportPong = {
  kind: "woo.transport.pong.v1";
  ping_now: number;
  now: number;
};
```

If no frame is received for 25 seconds, an endpoint SHOULD send ping. If no
frame or pong is received for 60 seconds, it SHOULD close and reconnect. These
timers are transport health checks only and MUST NOT feed VM logical time.

Relays MAY drop live events under backpressure, preferring to keep the newest
event per coalesce key. Relays MUST NOT drop accepted commit frames on an open
socket silently; if an accepted-frame queue overflows, the relay MUST send a
transport gap/error and force the browser through VTN9 catch-up.

Close-code profile for M4:

- use `1002` for malformed envelopes, unknown types, unsupported planes, and
  other protocol violations;
- use `1008` for authentication, authorization, expiry, or revocation policy
  failures;
- use `1009` for message-too-big;
- deployment-specific `4000`-`4999` close codes MAY add detail, but clients
  MUST handle the standard code class above.

### VTN19.4 Reconnect and resume

`resume_token` is a transport convenience, not durable state authority. It lets
the relay identify a recently disconnected socket and may preserve subscriptions
for a short deployment-local window, recommended 30 seconds. It does not
guarantee replay of accepted frames.

On reconnect, the browser MUST:

1. open a new WebSocket with the current session token and optional
   `resume_token`;
2. wait for `TransportHello`;
3. resubmit `Subscribe` for desired scopes, including last-known heads;
4. run VTN9 catch-up for each scope;
5. re-send only idempotent pending turn requests whose `(from, id)` keys remain
   valid within `TransportHello.idempotency_window_ms`.

The relay MAY restore live subscriptions from `resume_token`, but the browser
still sends explicit `Subscribe` messages so reconnect is correct when the
relay forgot all socket state. Live events missed while disconnected are not
recoverable.
