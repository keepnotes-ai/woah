# V2 turn network protocol

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **protocol**.

This document specifies the first buildable protocol draft for the v2 node
network sketched in [notes/2026-05-12-woo-v2-actor-local-vm-turns.md](../../notes/2026-05-12-woo-v2-actor-local-vm-turns.md).

It is **not** a compatibility revision of the v1 host-per-object deployment.
The v2 goal is functional parity with the current chat, pinboard/kanban, and
dubspace workloads while changing the distribution strategy:

- object placement is not the semantic authority boundary;
- deterministic VM turns are the atomic execution units;
- actor-local shards are execution caches;
- remote execution is whole-turn placement;
- remote execution normally returns state transfer;
- browser-hosted nodes are real nodes with narrow authority.

This document is draft, but it is intended to constrain prototype
implementation. The final byte encoding may change. The state machines and
validation rules should not change casually once implemented.

---

## VTN1. Scope and compatibility

The v2 protocol defines node-to-node and browser-node-to-relay messages for a
network of Woo nodes. A node may hold any combination of:

- actor-local execution cache;
- durable commit-scope state;
- stable anchor pages;
- projection-only display state;
- browser-local UI/audio state;
- live-only session state.

The protocol deliberately avoids a global object-location oracle. It routes
turns by advertised executable capability and validates authority at commit.

The v2 protocol does not require:

- one host per object;
- a global total order;
- compatibility with v1 Cloudflare Durable Object placement;
- exposing node device class in routing messages;
- advertising execution capability from every node.

The protocol does require:

- one clear commit scope for every committed turn;
- deterministic transcripts for committed VM turns;
- authenticated envelopes on authority-bearing paths;
- verifiable state transfer before cache install;
- explicit separation between durable committed frames and live-only events.

## VTN2. Protocol planes

The protocol has four logical planes. One physical WebSocket, HTTP/2 stream, or
DO RPC channel may carry all of them, but implementations MUST preserve the
semantic separation.

| Plane | Purpose | Durable? | Authority-bearing? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Execution | Ask a capable node to run a whole VM turn. | No, except returned transcript/receipt. | Indirectly. |
| Commit | Submit, validate, order, and acknowledge transcripts. | Yes. | Yes. |
| State | Transfer projections, deltas, closures, and snapshot pages. | Cache fill. | Receive authority is checked. |
| Live | Chat lines, gesture previews, cursors, presence hints, subscription control. | No. | Only within live/session policy. |

Messages MUST NOT smuggle durable world mutation through the live plane. Live
verbs may emit observations and update ephemeral session/browser state, but
durable object cells change only through an accepted commit frame.

## VTN3. References, hashes, and positions

The prototype uses canonical JSON values unless a message field explicitly names
binary bytes. Hashes are over canonical bytes with the type name included in the
preimage.

```ts
type NodeRef = string;       // "node:<deployment>:<id>"
type ScopeRef = string;      // "scope:<id>"
type ObjRef = string;        // stable Woo object id
type ActorRef = ObjRef;
type SessionRef = string;    // authenticated live/session connection
type TurnId = string;        // client or node chosen idempotency key
type Hash = string;          // multihash or "sha256:<base64url>"
type Epoch = number;
type Seq = number;

type ScopeHead = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  seq: Seq;
  hash: Hash;
};

type CommitPosition = ScopeHead;
```

A `ScopeHead` names a commit-scope epoch and the last accepted transcript in
that epoch. Epochs fence sequencer/commit-scope migration. Messages that carry
an epoch MUST be rejected if the receiver knows that epoch is stale.

## VTN4. Message envelope

Every v2 protocol message is carried in an envelope:

```ts
type Envelope<T> = {
  v: 2;
  type: string;
  id: string;
  from: NodeRef;
  to?: NodeRef | ScopeRef | SessionRef;
  actor?: ActorRef;
  session?: SessionRef;
  reply_to?: string;
  sent_at?: number;
  expires_at?: number;
  auth: AuthContext;
  trace?: string;
  body: T;
};

type AuthContext = {
  mode: "same_deployment_mac" | "signature" | "session" | "anonymous_advisory";
  key_id?: string;
  signature?: string;
  mac?: string;
  claims?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

`sent_at` and `expires_at` are routing metadata. They are not deterministic VM
inputs. A turn that needs time receives it through `LogicalInputs`.

Authority-bearing messages MUST use `same_deployment_mac`, `signature`, or
`session` authentication. Advisory gossip MAY use `anonymous_advisory` only on
trusted local links where spoofing is not load-bearing.

The tuple `(from, id)` is the envelope idempotency key unless a body-level
`turn.id` or `submit.id` narrows the key further. Receivers MUST make retry of
the same authority-bearing message idempotent for the configured retention
window.

## VTN5. Cells and atoms

The protocol reasons about object state as cells.

```ts
type CellRef =
  | { kind: "prop"; object: ObjRef; name: string }
  | { kind: "verb"; object: ObjRef; name: string; version?: string }
  | { kind: "parent"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "features"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "owner"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "perms"; object: ObjRef; name?: string }
  | { kind: "location"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "contents"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "lifecycle"; object: ObjRef }
  | { kind: "catalog"; name: string; version?: string };

type CellVersion = {
  cell: CellRef;
  version: string;
  hash?: Hash;
};
```

An implementation MAY store cells differently internally. On the wire, reads,
writes, validation, and transfer proofs use this vocabulary.

Routing atoms are compact hashes of typed preimages. The preimage MUST include
the atom kind. For private scopes, the preimage MUST also include a
scope/epoch-specific salt known only to authorized participants.

Examples:

```text
obj:#123
cell:prop:#123.location
verb:#note.read@17
parent:#thing
actor:#alice
scope:#living-room
effect:write
route:live
```

Atom hashes route work. They do not prove authority or state correctness.

## VTN6. VM turn

A VM turn is one atomic deterministic execution segment. A turn starts from a
call request and ends when the VM returns, raises, or parks at an explicit
coordination boundary.

```ts
type TurnCall = {
  id: TurnId;
  actor: ActorRef;
  target: ObjRef;
  verb: string;
  args: WooValue[];
  caller?: ObjRef;
  route: "committed" | "live";
};

type LogicalInputs = {
  assigned_seq?: Seq;
  logical_time?: number;
  entropy?: Array<{ id: string; bytes: string }>;
  external?: Array<{ id: string; value_hash: Hash; value?: WooValue }>;
};
```

Committed turns MUST be deterministic given:

- the turn call;
- bytecode/source hashes;
- logical inputs;
- the validated read-set cell values;
- the selected commit-scope rules.

Committed turns MUST NOT read wall-clock time, host RNG, unsequenced external
IO, host-local enumeration order, or ambient state unless the input is admitted
through `LogicalInputs` or the read set.

Live turns are not replayed as durable history. They SHOULD still use the same
VM recorder in diagnostic mode so live/durable boundary mistakes are visible.

## VTN7. Effect transcript

An effect transcript is the canonical record submitted for commit validation
and replay.

```ts
type EffectTranscript = {
  kind: "woo.effect_transcript.v1";
  id: TurnId;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  base: ScopeHead;
  call: TurnCall;
  vm: {
    engine: string;
    catalog_hashes: Record<string, Hash>;
    verb_hashes: Record<string, Hash>;
  };
  inputs: LogicalInputs;
  reads: TranscriptRead[];
  writes: TranscriptWrite[];
  creates?: TranscriptCreate[];
  recycles?: TranscriptRecycle[];
  observations: WooObservation[];
  result?: WooValue;
  error?: WooError;
  complete: boolean;
  pre_state_hash?: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
};

type TranscriptRead = {
  cell: CellRef;
  version: string;
  value_hash?: Hash;
  purpose?: "dispatch" | "permission" | "user" | "builtin" | "projection";
};

type TranscriptWrite = {
  cell: CellRef;
  prior?: string;
  value_hash: Hash;
  value?: WooValue;
  op: "set" | "delete" | "append" | "remove" | "replace";
};

type TranscriptCreate = {
  object: ObjRef;
  parent: ObjRef;
  owner: ObjRef;
  initial_cells: TranscriptWrite[];
};

type TranscriptRecycle = {
  object: ObjRef;
  final_version?: string;
};
```

`complete: false` means the recorder observed an untracked native effect or an
execution boundary that cannot be validated. A commit scope MUST NOT accept an
incomplete transcript as a durable turn. It MAY store incomplete transcripts as
diagnostics.

Transcript values MAY be omitted when the receiver already has the matching
content-addressed state page. Validation still needs either the value or a
trusted way to retrieve it by `value_hash`.

Observation payloads are part of the transcript for committed turns. Live-only
events are not.

## VTN8. Commit plane

The commit plane orders accepted transcripts within one commit scope.

```ts
type CommitSubmit = {
  kind: "woo.commit.submit.v1";
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  expected: ScopeHead;
  transcript: EffectTranscript;
  leases?: LeaseToken[];
  requested_transfer?: TransferRequest;
};

type CommitAccepted = {
  kind: "woo.commit.accepted.v1";
  id: string;
  position: CommitPosition;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
  observations: WooObservation[];
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
  receipt: CommitReceipt;
};

type CommitConflict = {
  kind: "woo.commit.conflict.v1";
  id: string;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  current: ScopeHead;
  reason:
    | "stale_head"
    | "read_version_mismatch"
    | "write_fence_missing"
    | "permission_denied"
    | "bytecode_mismatch"
    | "nondeterministic"
    | "incomplete_transcript"
    | "scope_mismatch";
  conflicting_cells?: CellRef[];
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
};

type CommitReceipt = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  seq: Seq;
  prev_hash: Hash;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  post_state_hash: Hash;
  signer: NodeRef | ScopeRef;
  signature?: string;
  mac?: string;
};
```

A commit scope validates a `CommitSubmit` in this order:

1. Envelope authentication and actor/session authority.
2. Scope and epoch match.
3. Idempotency key replay check.
4. Transcript is complete and targets this scope.
5. VM/catalog/verb hashes are accepted for the scope epoch.
6. Logical inputs are valid and not duplicated.
7. Read versions match current state, unless a declared validation rule allows
   the read to be stale projection data.
8. Permission reads and policy checks are included in the read set.
9. Writes are authorized by actor/session and any required lease/fence token.
10. Applying writes yields the transcript `post_state_hash`.
11. The receipt is recorded and returned.

If validation fails, no write from the transcript is committed. The executor may
catch up and retry the whole turn.

## VTN9. Catch-up and applied frames

Subscribers consume committed state through applied frames.

```ts
type Subscribe = {
  kind: "woo.subscribe.v1";
  scopes: ScopeRef[];
  from?: Record<ScopeRef, ScopeHead>;
  wants: "applied" | "projection" | "both";
};

type AppliedFrame = {
  kind: "woo.applied.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  position: CommitPosition;
  transcript_hash: Hash;
  call?: TurnCall;
  observations: WooObservation[];
  result?: WooValue;       // only for authorized originator
  state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
};

type CatchupRequest = {
  kind: "woo.catchup.request.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  from: ScopeHead;
  limit?: number;
  wants?: "transcript" | "applied" | "projection";
};

type CatchupReply = {
  kind: "woo.catchup.reply.v1";
  scope: ScopeRef;
  from: ScopeHead;
  to: ScopeHead;
  frames: AppliedFrame[];
  has_more: boolean;
};
```

`AppliedFrame` is the durable successor of the v1 `op:"applied"` frame. It is
the canonical subscription frame for committed observations and materialized
state changes. Clients MUST treat missing positions as gaps and use catch-up.

## VTN10. Execution plane

Execution RPC asks another node to execute a whole turn. The request target is a
node believed to be a capable executor, not an object's permanent home.

```ts
type TurnKey = {
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  atoms: string[];
  write_atoms?: string[];
  effects: number;
};

type TurnExecRequest = {
  kind: "woo.turn.exec.v1";
  id: TurnId;
  turn: TurnCall & { route: "committed" };
  scope: ScopeRef;
  caller_head: ScopeHead;
  predicted: TurnKey;
  required_consistency: "presentation" | "semantic" | "write";
  requested_transfer?: TransferRequest;
  max_transfer_bytes?: number;
  selected_ad?: string;
  commit_policy?: "execute_and_commit" | "execute_only";
};

type TurnExecReply =
  | {
      kind: "woo.turn.exec.reply.v1";
      ok: true;
      id: TurnId;
      outcome: { result?: WooValue; error?: WooError };
      transcript: EffectTranscript;
      commit?: CommitAccepted;
      state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
      ads?: ExecCapabilityAd[];
    }
  | {
      kind: "woo.turn.exec.reply.v1";
      ok: false;
      id: TurnId;
      reason:
        | "missing_state"
        | "stale_head"
        | "scope_mismatch"
        | "busy"
        | "policy_denied"
        | "ad_expired"
        | "transfer_too_large"
        | "not_deterministic";
      missing_atoms?: string[];
      current?: ScopeHead;
      better_ad?: ExecCapabilityAd;
      state_transfer?: StateTransfer;
    };
```

The default `commit_policy` is `execute_and_commit`. A successful default reply
MUST include an accepted commit receipt. `execute_only` is reserved for local
simulation and diagnostic deployments; clients MUST NOT treat an `execute_only`
result as authoritative state.

An executor SHOULD refuse before running the VM if required atoms are obviously
missing. If missing state is discovered during execution, the executor MUST
abort without commit and return `missing_state`. Partial transcripts from such
runs are diagnostics only.

## VTN11. Capability gossip

Capability ads are compact routing hints.

```ts
type Bloom = {
  m: number;              // number of bits
  k: number;              // number of hash functions
  salt_id?: string;
  bits: string;           // base64url bitset
};

type ExecCapabilityAd = {
  kind: "woo.exec.ad.v1";
  ad: string;
  node: NodeRef;
  expires_at: number;
  scope: ScopeRef;
  epoch: Epoch;
  head: ScopeHead;
  covers: Bloom;
  accepts: Bloom;
  effects: number;
  factor: number;
  max_transfer_bytes?: number;
  auth?: AuthContext;
};
```

`covers` means "this node probably has the state, code, metadata, and log tail."
`accepts` means "this node is willing to run this target/verb/scope shape."

Nodes MUST NOT encode device class, battery state, permanence tier, or platform
kind as protocol categories. Low-capability or low-permanence nodes simply do
not advertise, or they advertise narrowly with a worse opaque `factor`.

Candidate selection:

```text
ad not expired
ad.scope and ad.epoch match the TurnKey
all TurnKey atoms are probably in ad.covers
turn-shape atoms are probably in ad.accepts
TurnKey effects are a subset of ad.effects
rank by observed latency + ad.factor + estimated transfer cost + failure penalty
```

Ads are advisory. Commit receipts and state proofs are authoritative.

## VTN12. State plane

State transfer fills execution and display caches. It does not grant write
authority.

```ts
type TransferRequest = {
  mode: "projection" | "delta" | "closure";
  base?: ScopeHead;
  max_bytes?: number;
  atoms?: string[];
};

type StateTransfer = {
  kind: "woo.state.transfer.v1";
  mode: "projection" | "delta" | "closure";
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  base?: ScopeHead;
  to?: ScopeHead;
  pages?: StatePageRef[];
  inline_pages?: StatePage[];
  transcript_tail?: EffectTranscript[];
  applied?: AppliedFrame[];
  projection?: WooValue;
  proof?: StateProof;
};

type StatePageRef = {
  hash: Hash;
  bytes?: number;
  uri?: string;
};

type StatePage = {
  hash: Hash;
  codec: "canonical-json" | "cbor";
  bytes: string;          // base64url
};

type StateProof = {
  root: Hash;
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  epoch?: Epoch;
  seq?: Seq;
  receipt?: CommitReceipt;
};
```

Transfer modes:

- `projection`: enough for display and command planning, not authoritative
  execution unless marked as a semantic read by a later committed turn;
- `delta`: applied frames or transcript tail since a known head;
- `closure`: executable state bundle for a predicted turn, including cells,
  parent/feature/verb metadata, bytecode hashes, and permission facts.

Receivers MUST verify page hashes and proofs before installing cache. Receivers
MUST apply authorization filtering before exposing transferred values to a
browser, actor, or agent.

## VTN13. Live plane

Live events are low-latency, non-durable messages. They are not replayed through
catch-up and they do not advance a commit-scope sequence.

```ts
type LiveEvent = {
  kind: "woo.live.event.v1";
  id: string;
  source: ObjRef;
  actor?: ActorRef;
  scope?: ScopeRef;
  audience?: {
    actors?: ActorRef[];
    sessions?: SessionRef[];
    scope?: ScopeRef;
  };
  observation: WooObservation;
  coalesce?: string;
};
```

Live events cover:

- direct chat lines and tells that are intentionally not durable;
- dubspace slider/cursor/gesture previews;
- transient presence hints;
- UI-specific ephemeral signals.

Live event delivery is best-effort. Relays MAY drop or coalesce live events
under backpressure. Durable changes MUST use the commit plane instead.

Catalog verbs that are callable through the live plane MUST be declared as
live/direct safe. A live/direct-safe verb:

- may emit live observations;
- may read authorized projection or semantic state;
- may update ephemeral session/browser-local state;
- MUST NOT write durable object cells;
- MUST NOT create, recycle, or move durable objects;
- MUST NOT rely on its live execution for future replay.

## VTN14. Browser node

A browser node is a v2 node running inside a browser, normally as a Web Worker.
It is not just a renderer.

Required browser-node components:

- worker-hosted VM/runtime subset;
- IndexedDB cache for state pages, projections, transcript tails, and pending
  turns;
- WebSocket connection to a session relay;
- subscription client for applied frames and projections;
- live-plane sender/receiver for chat, cursors, and gesture previews;
- commit submitter for tentative local transcripts;
- reconciliation layer for accepted/conflicted turns;
- state-page and receipt verifier.

Initial browser-node authority:

- MAY execute deterministic committed turns locally for the authenticated actor
  when it has an authorized closure;
- MAY submit transcripts to a server-side commit scope;
- MAY emit live events allowed by session policy;
- MAY receive only authorized projections/closures;
- MUST NOT commit without server-side validation;
- MUST NOT advertise broad `ExecCapabilityAd`s;
- MAY advertise a narrow session-local capability to its relay in later
  milestones.

Browser-node board edit flow:

```text
UI -> worker: move_pin(pin, x, y)
worker: build TurnKey and verify local closure
worker: run tentative VM turn and record transcript
worker -> relay/commit scope: CommitSubmit
commit scope -> worker: CommitAccepted or CommitConflict
worker -> UI: confirm, patch-forward, or report conflict
```

Browser-node dubspace preview flow:

```text
UI -> worker: preview_control(target, name, value)
worker -> local audio: apply preview immediately
worker -> relay live plane: LiveEvent(gesture_progress)
relay -> subscribers: best-effort LiveEvent
```

Browser-node dubspace commit flow:

```text
UI -> worker: set_control(target, name, value)
worker: run deterministic turn and record transcript
worker -> commit scope: CommitSubmit
commit scope -> subscribers: AppliedFrame(control_changed)
browser audio engines apply the committed frame
```

## VTN15. Functional parity requirements

The first implementation that claims v2 protocol support MUST pass parity
scenarios for the existing bundled workloads.

### Chat

- actors enter, leave, move, take, drop, and observe room activity;
- direct speech/tells are low-latency live events;
- containment changes and take/drop conflicts are committed in canonical order;
- transparent chat embedded in pinboard/dubspace forwards as specified by the
  catalog.

### Pinboard and kanban

- notes/cards remain first-class objects;
- board layout, z-order, columns, and card order are durable committed state;
- composite verbs such as `add_note` and `add_card` are atomic turns;
- viewers receive applied frames for durable board changes;
- board mini-chat remains live-only unless a durable chat feature is installed;
- large boards can be opened through projection before full closure transfer.

### Dubspace

- high-rate slider/cursor previews use the live plane;
- final control changes, transport, tempo, patterns, and scene operations commit
  through the commit plane;
- browser audio engines apply both live previews and accepted committed frames;
- logical time replaces wall-clock reads for persistent transport state.

## VTN16. Prototype milestones

The prototype SHOULD land in this order:

1. Turn recorder and replay/diff in the current runtime.
2. In-process multi-node simulator with execution, commit, state, and live
   planes.
3. Content-addressed state transfer and fixed Bloom ad profile.
4. Browser-node worker with IndexedDB cache and relay transport.
5. Networked infrastructure nodes, anchors, and disposable executors.
6. Eviction, cold activation, transcript compaction, and chaos tests.

The first milestone is successful when chat, pinboard, and dubspace committed
turns produce complete replayable transcripts, and live-only interactions are
classified as live rather than smuggled durable mutation.

## VTN17. Open decisions before production

Prototype implementation may proceed before these are fully settled, but a
production v2 spec needs decisions on:

- final binary encoding and compression;
- transcript retention and compaction policy;
- exact lease/fence requirements by cell kind;
- Bloom sizing and salt rotation;
- cross-operator signature policy;
- contested-scope promotion/demotion rules;
- browser optimistic-conflict UX;
- catalog update sequencing relative to ordinary turns;
- privacy profile for projection/state transfer to agents.
