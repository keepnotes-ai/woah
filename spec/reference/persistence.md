# Persistence and caching

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **reference**. CF-specific schema and cache implementation.

Covers per-DO SQLite schema, the cross-host bytecode/property cache, and invalidation. Task serialization details are in [../semantics/tasks.md §16](../semantics/tasks.md).

---

## 14. Persistence

Each Durable Object owns a SQLite database with the schema below. A DO holds the state of one or more woo objects: a single autonomous object (the default), or an entire anchor cluster (a root anchor object plus its anchored descendants — see [../semantics/objects.md §4.1](../semantics/objects.md#41-anchor-and-atomicity-scope)).

Per-object tables (`property_def`, `property_value`, `verb`, `child`, `content`, `event_schema`, `ancestor_chain`) carry an `object_id` column scoping each row to one of the hosted objects. Per-host caches (`ancestor_verb_cache`, `ancestor_prop_cache`) are keyed by the *defining* object — multiple hosted objects sharing the same ancestor share one cache entry. Per-host coordination tables (sessions, sockets) are not scoped to a hosted object.

> **This schema is the CF backend's storage encoding**, not a contract on runtime types. The runtime works with the TS types in [`src/core/types.ts`](../../src/core/types.ts) and accesses storage through the [`ObjectRepository`](../../src/core/repository.ts) interface ([cloudflare.md §R3](cloudflare.md#r3-per-object-repository-interface)). Other backends (in-memory, local SQLite, JSON-folder) are free to encode differently as long as they satisfy the interface. Where this schema's encoding differs from the runtime types, the encoding is "how the CF SQLite stores it"; the runtime never sees the raw SQL shape.

Local development SQLite (`LocalSQLiteRepository`) stamps databases with
`PRAGMA user_version = 1`. Version `0` predates local SQLite schema versioning,
so a non-empty local SQLite file at version `0` is treated as too old and is
recreated from the current schema on startup. Future `user_version` bumps must
choose explicitly between a real local migration and another reset.

### 14.2 Singleton DOs and Directory schema

| DO | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Directory` | Holds the corename map and world metadata. Read-mostly, off the hot path. Does **not** mint IDs (see [../semantics/objects.md §5.5](../semantics/objects.md#55-id-allocation)). |
| `$system` (`#0`) | Bootstrap object. Holds corename properties. |

Directory's SQLite schema:

```sql
-- Corename map: $foo → ULID. Recycle removes the row.
CREATE TABLE corename (
  name   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- e.g. "$wiz"
  target TEXT NOT NULL                -- ULID
);

-- ID → host route. Written once at object creation; never updated, never
-- deleted. Recycle does NOT remove the row: stale refs continue to route
-- to the host that holds the (now-tombstoned) object, so the host can
-- distinguish 'recycled' from 'never existed' for is_recycled() and for
-- authoring-tool diagnostics. See §14.2.1.
CREATE TABLE id_route (
  id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- ULID
  host TEXT NOT NULL                  -- DO name / host id (§R1.1)
);

-- World metadata.
CREATE TABLE world_meta (
  key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### 14.2.1 Tombstones

ULID liveness is tracked **per anchor cluster**, not in the central Directory.
Each cluster's host owns a `tombstone` table:

```sql
-- Recycled ULIDs. Survive backup/restore.
CREATE TABLE tombstone (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- the recycled ULID
  recycled_at INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- ms since epoch
  reason      TEXT                 -- 'recycle' | 'force_recycle'; nullable for legacy entries
);
```

Lookup contract (the full path for a stale ULID dereference):

1. The caller resolves the ULID via Directory's `id_route` table. The route row
   is **immutable** — recycle does not remove it — so the route still resolves,
   pointing at the tombstone host.
2. The host receives the dispatch / property request and consults its own
   `tombstone` table. A hit returns "tombstoned"; the host responds with
   `E_OBJNF` per
   [../semantics/failures.md §F7](../semantics/failures.md#f7-lifecycle-failures).
3. A miss falls through to the ordinary `objects` table lookup.

Two storage invariants make this work:

- **Route immutability.** The `id_route` row is written once at object creation
  and never updated or deleted. Recycle leaves it in place. This guarantees
  that stale refs reach the tombstone host instead of failing with a
  routing-layer not-found.
- **Tombstone immutability.** A `tombstone` row is immutable once written.
  Tombstones are never deleted in normal operation; an offline tool may sweep
  entries past a configurable retention horizon, but doing so risks ULID
  collision on backup/restore and is therefore disabled by default.

The Directory does **not** mirror tombstones for live hosts: routing only
cares which host owns the ULID, and that host is the only authority on
liveness while it is alive. One bounded exception applies once the host
has been torn down — see §14.2.2.

The recycle transaction inserts the tombstone row in the same SQLite
transaction that deletes the object's storage rows
([../semantics/recycle.md §RC3](../semantics/recycle.md#rc3-bookkeeping) step 9).
Either both happen or neither does.

### 14.2.2 Inherited tombstones (after host teardown)

When a recycle leaves a DO with no live hosted **payload** objects
(host-scoped support copies excluded — see [../semantics/recycle.md §RC11.1](../semantics/recycle.md#rc111-trigger)),
the DO migrates its tombstone roster to the Directory in one or more
batched requests and then calls `state.storage.deleteAll()`, which
deallocates its stored data. The DO id remains reachable; reactivations
hit the §RC11.6 cold-load guard. See
[../semantics/recycle.md §RC11](../semantics/recycle.md#rc11-host-teardown-after-recycle)
for the full sequence. After the handoff completes, the Directory holds
the tombstone authority for those ULIDs:

```sql
-- Tombstones inherited from torn-down hosts. Append-only.
CREATE TABLE inherited_tombstone (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- the recycled ULID
  former_host TEXT NOT NULL,       -- ULID of the self-hosted root whose DO is gone
  recycled_at INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- ms since epoch (preserved from the host's tombstone row)
  reason      TEXT                 -- 'recycle' | 'force_recycle'; preserved from host's tombstone
);
```

The host populates this table by POSTing to the Directory's
`/__internal/inherit-tombstones` endpoint (recycle.md §RC11.3 step 2), in
the same teardown sequence that ends with `state.storage.deleteAll()`.

Lookup contract — extended for inherited tombstones. The §14.2.1 path
gains a Directory-local branch when the route is gone:

1. Caller resolves the ULID via Directory's `id_route` table.
2. **(new)** If no `id_route` row exists, the Directory checks
   `inherited_tombstone`:
    - Hit → respond `E_OBJNF` ([../semantics/failures.md §F7](../semantics/failures.md#f7-lifecycle-failures))
      with `is_recycled() = true`. No DO is woken.
    - Miss → respond "never existed" with `is_recycled() = false`.
3. Otherwise dispatch to the host (the §14.2.1 path).

This is the *only* path that removes a row from `id_route`, and it does so
only for ULIDs whose tombstone has been promoted to the Directory in the
same operation. Route immutability (§14.2.1) is preserved for live hosts.

The Directory does not vacuum `inherited_tombstone` in normal operation;
the table grows monotonically. An offline tool may sweep entries past a
configurable horizon with the same backup/restore caveat as §14.2.1.

### 14.3 Atomicity

All writes within a single opcode are atomic (CF DOs give us SQLite transactions). A verb body is *not* atomic across yield points; cross-DO ops give other tasks a chance to interleave on each DO. Authors who need atomicity across multiple ops use `with_lock(obj) { ... }` (deferred to phase 2; simply documented for v1).

### 14.4 CommitScopeDO v2 authority schema

`CommitScopeDO` owns v2 commit authority state, not ordinary hosted object
storage, so it does not implement the `ObjectRepository` interface. Its
Cloudflare encoding still follows the same row-shaped rule: state that grows
with world size is split into rows, and accepted commits rewrite only rows
touched by the transcript.

```sql
CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_meta (
  id                     TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- always 'current'
  scope                  TEXT NOT NULL,
  relay_node             TEXT NOT NULL,
  serialized             TEXT,             -- legacy single-blob migration source only
  head                   TEXT NOT NULL,    -- JSON ShadowScopeHead
  idempotency_window_ms  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  version                INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  object_counter         INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  parked_task_counter    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  session_counter        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  updated_at             INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_object (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  body        TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON SerializedObject
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_session (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  body        TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON SerializedSession
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_log (
  space       TEXT NOT NULL,
  seq         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  body        TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON SpaceLogEntry
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (space, seq)
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_snapshot (
  space       TEXT NOT NULL,
  seq         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  body        TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON SpaceSnapshotRecord
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (space, seq)
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_task (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  body        TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON ParkedTaskRecord
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_tombstone (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_accepted_frame (
  scope         TEXT NOT NULL,
  seq           INTEGER NOT NULL,
  id            TEXT NOT NULL,
  position_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  body          TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON ShadowCommitAccepted
  updated_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(scope, seq)
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_transcript_tail (
  scope      TEXT NOT NULL,
  seq        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  hash       TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  body       TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON EffectTranscript
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_seen (
  idempotency_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  seen_at         INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE v2_commit_scope_reply (
  idempotency_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  body            TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON reply envelope
  updated_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

The `serialized` column remains nullable/empty so old scopes whose current row
contains a gzip or raw JSON world can be loaded once. After the first successful
open, implementations SHOULD rewrite the scope into the row tables and clear
`serialized`; new commits MUST NOT store the full world in that column.

## 15. Caching and invalidation

### 15.1 What's cached on a host

For each persistent obj this host knows about:
- Parent chain (`ancestor_chain` table)
- Verb bytecode by ancestor (`ancestor_verb_cache`)
- Property defaults by ancestor (`ancestor_prop_cache`)

Transient objects don't participate in caching (they're already local to their host).

### 15.2 Population

On first need (cache miss):
- For verbs: RPC to defining ancestor → store bytecode + version locally.
- For prop defaults: RPC to defining ancestor → store default + version.
- For chain: RPC to parent → recursively assemble, cache result.

The RPC is from the looking-up host to the *defining ancestor's host* (which holds the canonical bytecode), not to every host on the chain. We "skip" hosts in the middle by following the parent pointer to the next host with the verb defined.

### 15.3 Lazy version check

Cache freshness is checked on use, not pushed. Every cross-host RPC for verb call or property read carries `expected_version` for any cached artifact the caller is relying on:

- The receiver compares against its current version (`verb.version` or `property_def.version`).
- Match: normal reply.
- Mismatch: receiver returns the updated artifact (bytecode, default value) plus the new version in the same reply. Caller updates its cache.

Cost: a few bytes per RPC carrying the expected version. Benefit: no subscriber-list machinery, no fanout on edits, no eventual-consistency window beyond one RPC round trip. Edits become atomic operations on the defining object alone — they bump a version counter; descendants discover the change on next use.

When a chain changes (`chparent`), the reparented object bumps an internal chain version. Descendants are not notified eagerly; their next lookup carries the stale chain version, the receiver returns the new chain along with the artifacts, and the caller updates. Hosts may cache the chain with a short TTL (default 60s) for paths where the version-check round trip isn't worth the bytes.

### 15.4 Bounded cache size

A host caches at most N entries per category (configurable, default 4096). LRU eviction. With lazy version check there is no subscription state to clean up on eviction; an evicted entry's version is simply forgotten and refetched on next use.
