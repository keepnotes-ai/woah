# Persistence and caching

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **reference**. CF-specific schema and cache implementation.

Covers per-DO SQLite schema, the cross-host bytecode/property cache, and invalidation. Task serialization details are in [../semantics/tasks.md §16](../semantics/tasks.md).

## 14. Persistence

Each Durable Object owns a SQLite database with the schema below. A DO holds the state of one or more woo objects: a single autonomous object (the default), or an entire anchor cluster (a root anchor object plus its anchored descendants — see [../semantics/objects.md §4.1](../semantics/objects.md#41-anchor-and-atomicity-scope)).

Per-object tables (`property_def`, `property_value`, `verb`, `child`, `content`, `event_schema`, `ancestor_chain`) carry an `object_id` column scoping each row to one of the hosted objects. Per-host caches (`ancestor_verb_cache`, `ancestor_prop_cache`) are keyed by the *defining* object — multiple hosted objects sharing the same ancestor share one cache entry. Per-host coordination tables (sessions, sockets) are not scoped to a hosted object.

> **This schema is the CF backend's storage encoding**, not a contract on runtime types. The runtime works with the TS types in [`src/core/types.ts`](../../src/core/types.ts) and accesses storage through the [`ObjectRepository`](../../src/core/repository.ts) interface ([cloudflare.md §R3](cloudflare.md#r3-per-object-repository-interface)). Other backends (in-memory, local SQLite, JSON-folder) are free to encode differently as long as they satisfy the interface. Where this schema's encoding differs from the runtime types, the encoding is "how the CF SQLite stores it"; the runtime never sees the raw SQL shape.

### 14.1 Per-`MooObject` schema

```sql
-- Identity & metadata. One row per object hosted on this DO.
-- (Multiple rows when this DO hosts an anchor cluster.)

### 14.2 Singleton DOs and Directory schema

| DO | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Directory` | Holds the corename map and world metadata. Read-mostly, off the hot path. Does **not** mint IDs (see [../semantics/objects.md §5.5](../semantics/objects.md#55-id-allocation)). |
| `$system` (`#0`) | Bootstrap object. Holds corename properties. |

Directory's SQLite schema:

```sql
-- Corename map: $foo → ULID. Recycle removes the row.
CREATE TABLE corename (
  name   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- e.g. "$wiz"
  target TEXT NOT NULL                -- ULID
);

-- ID → host route. Written once at object creation; never updated, never
-- deleted. Recycle does NOT remove the row: stale refs continue to route
-- to the host that holds the (now-tombstoned) object, so the host can
-- distinguish 'recycled' from 'never existed' for is_recycled() and for
-- authoring-tool diagnostics. See §14.2.1.
CREATE TABLE id_route (
  id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- ULID
  host TEXT NOT NULL                  -- DO name / host id (§R1.1)
);

-- World metadata.
CREATE TABLE world_meta (
  key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### 14.2.1 Tombstones

ULID liveness is tracked **per anchor cluster**, not in the central Directory.
Each cluster's host owns a `tombstone` table:

```sql
-- Recycled ULIDs. Survive backup/restore.
CREATE TABLE tombstone (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- the recycled ULID
  recycled_at INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- ms since epoch
  reason      TEXT                 -- 'recycle' | 'force_recycle'; nullable for legacy entries
);
```

Lookup contract (the full path for a stale ULID dereference):

1. The caller resolves the ULID via Directory's `id_route` table. The route row
   is **immutable** — recycle does not remove it — so the route still resolves,
   pointing at the tombstone host.
2. The host receives the dispatch / property request and consults its own
   `tombstone` table. A hit returns "tombstoned"; the host responds with
   `E_OBJNF` per
   [../semantics/failures.md §F7](../semantics/failures.md#f7-lifecycle-failures).
3. A miss falls through to the ordinary `objects` table lookup.

Two storage invariants make this work:

- **Route immutability.** The `id_route` row is written once at object creation
  and never updated or deleted. Recycle leaves it in place. This guarantees
  that stale refs reach the tombstone host instead of failing with a
  routing-layer not-found.
- **Tombstone immutability.** A `tombstone` row is immutable once written.
  Tombstones are never deleted in normal operation; an offline tool may sweep
  entries past a configurable retention horizon, but doing so risks ULID
  collision on backup/restore and is therefore disabled by default.

The Directory does **not** mirror tombstones: routing only cares which host
owns the ULID, and that host is the only authority on liveness.

The recycle transaction inserts the tombstone row in the same SQLite
transaction that deletes the object's storage rows
([../semantics/recycle.md §RC3](../semantics/recycle.md#rc3-bookkeeping) step 9).
Either both happen or neither does.

### 14.3 Atomicity

All writes within a single opcode are atomic (CF DOs give us SQLite transactions). A verb body is *not* atomic across yield points; cross-DO ops give other tasks a chance to interleave on each DO. Authors who need atomicity across multiple ops use `with_lock(obj) { ... }` (deferred to phase 2; simply documented for v1).

---

## 15. Caching and invalidation

### 15.1 What's cached on a host

For each persistent obj this host knows about:
- Parent chain (`ancestor_chain` table)
- Verb bytecode by ancestor (`ancestor_verb_cache`)
- Property defaults by ancestor (`ancestor_prop_cache`)

Transient objects don't participate in caching (they're already local to their host).

### 15.2 Population

On first need (cache miss):
- For verbs: RPC to defining ancestor → store bytecode + version locally.
- For prop defaults: RPC to defining ancestor → store default + version.
- For chain: RPC to parent → recursively assemble, cache result.

The RPC is from the looking-up host to the *defining ancestor's host* (which holds the canonical bytecode), not to every host on the chain. We "skip" hosts in the middle by following the parent pointer to the next host with the verb defined.

### 15.3 Lazy version check

Cache freshness is checked on use, not pushed. Every cross-host RPC for verb call or property read carries `expected_version` for any cached artifact the caller is relying on:

- The receiver compares against its current version (`verb.version` or `property_def.version`).
- Match: normal reply.
- Mismatch: receiver returns the updated artifact (bytecode, default value) plus the new version in the same reply. Caller updates its cache.

Cost: a few bytes per RPC carrying the expected version. Benefit: no subscriber-list machinery, no fanout on edits, no eventual-consistency window beyond one RPC round trip. Edits become atomic operations on the defining object alone — they bump a version counter; descendants discover the change on next use.

When a chain changes (`chparent`), the reparented object bumps an internal chain version. Descendants are not notified eagerly; their next lookup carries the stale chain version, the receiver returns the new chain along with the artifacts, and the caller updates. Hosts may cache the chain with a short TTL (default 60s) for paths where the version-check round trip isn't worth the bytes.

### 15.4 Bounded cache size

A host caches at most N entries per category (configurable, default 4096). LRU eviction. With lazy version check there is no subscription state to clean up on eviction; an evicted entry's version is simply forgotten and refetched on next use.
