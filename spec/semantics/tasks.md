# Task lifecycle

> Part of the [woo specification](../../SPEC.md). Layer: **semantics**.

Covers the task state machine, suspend across host eviction (the load-bearing test for the architecture), cross-host RPC continuations, fork, and read.

## 16. Task lifecycle and suspension

### 16.1 States

```
created → running → done
              ↓
          suspended (sleep timer)
              ↓
           running (alarm fires)

          awaiting_read (event from player)
              ↓
           running (input arrives)

```

### 16.2 Suspend across host eviction

`SUSPEND seconds`:
1. Serialize `Task` to JSON (frames, locals, stacks, handlers, principal fields).
2. Insert/update row in `task` with `state='suspended'`, `resume_at = now + seconds*1000`, `serialized = blob`.
3. Set the host's scheduler alarm to `min(resume_at)` over all suspended tasks.
4. Yield from VM. The host may hibernate.

When the alarm fires:
1. Host wakes (persistent storage available, no in-memory state).
2. Read all tasks where `resume_at <= now`.
3. For each: deserialize, resume execution.

If the suspended task belongs to a space, step 3 happens by appending a fresh sequenced `$resume` message to that space. The `$resume` body names the parked task and carries the serialized continuation needed to hydrate the VM stack. The wake effect gets a new `seq` at alarm time; the original call's `seq` records only that the task parked. This keeps replay honest: no hidden side-channel mutation can occur after a sequenced call without a corresponding sequenced frame.

Host-only suspended tasks (no `space` recorded) resume directly on the owning host. They are for internal bookkeeping and must not mutate space-anchored state.

This is the load-bearing test for the architecture; it must work for `seconds = 86400 * 365`.

> **Open question:** the design here is straightforward but needs empirical validation against the runtime's alarm-after-hibernate behavior — particularly that alarms set across multi-day boundaries fire reliably and that hibernated state is fully reconstructible from persistent storage alone. First runtime task: write a test that suspends for 24h+ and verifies resume. See [LATER.md](../../LATER.md).

### 16.3 Cross-host RPC

`CALL_VERB` to a remote object is an awaited host RPC:

1. Origin keeps the caller continuation in memory and sends `{target, name, args, ctx, correlation_id}` to the receiver host.
2. Receiver runs the callee frame under the caller's authority and returns `{correlation_id, result, observations}`.
3. Origin pushes the result onto its top frame's stack and appends the returned observations to the current frame.

The v1 baseline does not persist a parked RPC task. If the origin host crashes while awaiting the reply, the in-memory task is lost just like any other uncheckpointed running task. Idempotency on retry is per [protocol/hosts.md §3.4](../protocol/hosts.md#34-host-rpc-invariants) — a duplicate request with the same correlation id returns the cached reply rather than re-executing.

### 16.4 Killing tasks

`kill_task(task_id)` (a builtin, wizard or owner only) sets the task state to a terminal state and deletes the row. Any in-flight RPC reply is discarded on receipt.

### 16.5 Forked tasks

`FORK seconds verb_obj verb_name args` spawns a new task on the *same* host (the forking object's). The forked task gets:
- Fresh activation stack with one frame for the named verb call
- `progr` = forking verb's `progr`
- `player` = forking task's `player` (sticky)
- `caller` = `#-1`
- Fresh tick budget

If the forking object is recycled before the timer fires, forked tasks are killed.

If the forked task has a `space`, wakeup dispatches the named verb through that space's normal `$space:call` path. The runtime synthesizes `{actor, target: verb_obj, verb: verb_name, args}` at fire time and the space allocates a fresh seq. The original call records that a fork was scheduled; the later wake frame records what the fork did. Off-space forks remain host-only and must not mutate space-anchored state.

### 16.6 Read tasks

`READ player`:
1. Task state → `awaiting_read`, `awaiting_player = player`.
2. When the next input event arrives for that player, the player host finds the task awaiting and resumes it with the input value on the operand stack.
3. If the waiting task belongs to a space, input delivery resumes through a
   sequenced `$resume` frame. The frame body records the parked task id, the
   serialized continuation, and the input value so replay sees the input that
   woke the task.

Multiple tasks awaiting reads on the same player are queued; first-in-first-out.

### 16.7 Fork and suspend caps

Suspended-task hoarding is bounded at the task and object level here; per-owner caps are part of storage quota in [permissions.md §11.7](permissions.md#117-storage-quotas-and-accounting).

| Level | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Per-task fork budget | 100 forks per parent task | A single verb invocation cannot fork more than this many child tasks. |
| Per-object live-fork cap | 1000 active parked tasks | A single object cannot host more parked forks than this. |

`FORK`/`SUSPEND` over any cap raises `E_QUOTA`. The currently running task is unaffected; only further parking operations fail. `SUSPEND` shares the per-object cap but has no per-task budget — a verb body can suspend itself once per call without restriction.

Caps are tunable per-world via `$server_options.fork_quota_*`.
